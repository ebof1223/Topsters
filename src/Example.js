            "Kid A is the fourth studio album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 2 October 2000 by Parlophone. On the verge of a breakdown after promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical change in direction. Radiohead replaced their rock sound with synthesisers, drum machines, the ondes Martenot, string orchestras and brass instruments, incorporating influences from genres such as electronic music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music. They recorded Kid A with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20 tracks; Radiohead saved many of them for their subsequent album, Amnesiac, released the following year.\n\nRadiohead released no singles or music videos to promote Kid A and conducted few interviews and photoshoots, instead becoming one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool. The album was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services and the album was leaked before release.\n\nKid A debuted at the top of the charts in Britain, where it went platinum in the first week, and it became Radiohead's first number-one album in the United States. Like OK Computer, it won a Grammy for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. Its departure from Radiohead's earlier sound initially divided fans and critics, but it later attracted widespread acclaim; at the turn of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it number 67 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Kid+A\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

NME named it the 98th greatest album of all time.\n\nIn the Aeroplane Over the Sea is widely considered to be written about Anne Frank due to lyrics seemingly referring to her, such as lines referring to her birth and death dates. Though the group has never officially stated that the album is indeed about Frank, it is a popular theory among fans, and Jeff Mangum has mentioned the influence her diary, The Diary of a Young Girl, has made on his craft and outright referred to "Holland, 1945" being about her while performing live. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neutral+Milk+Hotel/In+the+Aeroplane+Over+the+Sea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released on October 24, 2006 through Reprise Records, it was produced by Rob Cavallo, known for having produced multiple albums for Goo Goo Dolls and Green Day. It is a rock opera centering on a dying character with cancer known as "The Patient". The album tells the story of his apparent death, experiences in the afterlife, and subsequent reflection on his life.\n\nFour singles were released from the album: "Welcome to the Black Parade", "Famous Last Words", "I Don\'t Love You", and "Teenagers".[1] The Black Parade has received generally favorable reviews, and the band achieved its first Number 1 single in the UK with "Welcome to the Black Parade". The album debuted at number two on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart and is also certified as platinum by the RIAA,[2] as well as a Platinum certification in the UK and a Gold certificacion in Argentina by the CAPIF and in Chile by the IFPI Chile.[3][4] The Black Parade was given the Platinum Europe Award by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for 1 million sales in Europe. The limited edition boxed set also earned My Chemical Romance a Grammy Award nomination.[5][6] In the video game Guitar Hero II (Xbox 360 version), the song "Dead!" was added to the game\'s track list prior to the earlier PS2 version, and the three songs "Teenagers," "Famous Last Words" and "This Is How I Disappear" are available for download. The Black Parade has sold 1,610,000 copies in the US as of October 2010, and has sold 3,000,000 copies worldwide. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Chemical+Romance/The+Black+Parade">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Swans’ previous album, 2012’s ‘The Seer’ (Spotlight feature), was monumental, a behemoth of bleakness and self-flagellation, a meditation on the sublime from which these songs were directly born.\n\nA harsher parent is hard to imagine, but while its progeny hasn’t fallen far from the tree, ‘To Be Kind’ is altogether more colourful, an expansive record – fleshier, bloodier and lusciously psychedelic.\n\nWhere ‘The Seer’ gazed deep into the void, this sets its sights on the stars. It’s ‘kosmische musik’ in every sense, utilising the talents of several guest musicians, labelmate Cold Specks, previous collaborator Little Annie and the imperious St Vincent. \n\n‘Screen Shot’ is a cyclical, insistent opening, hypnotic and distant. A sinister tribute to Howlin’ Wolf, ‘Just A Little Boy (For Chester Burnett)’, is Delta blues through a David Lynch filter: dirty, disconcerting and darkly feral. \n\nThe sickly, influenza-wheezing funk of ‘A Little God In My Hands’ (below) is a relative breeze at just over seven minutes. It’s a breather before ‘Bring The Sun’: an epic sonic baptism of shamanistic, trance-inducing, ‘Ummagumma’-era Pink Floyd instrumentation and cacophonous incantation.\n\nThe call-to-arms of ‘Toussaint L’Ouverture’, named after the Haitian revolutionary, is a brutal yet buoyant celebration, while the lean ‘Oxygen’ is super tight, a funk-based post-rock propulsion of big ballooning sound punctuated by brass. Later, ‘Nathalie Neal’ is a haunting mélange of vibraphones and spoken-word.\n\nFrontman Michael Gira’s ever-abstract lyrics give plenty of room for interpretation throughout. Imagine Karlheinz Stockhausen’s jarring classicism, Captain Beefheart\'s twisted blues, and the industrialism of Einstürzende Neubauten coalescing into a swirling musical miasma. Near perfection.\n\n9/10\n\nWords: Anna Wilson <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Swans/To+Be+Kind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Red is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 22, 2012 through Big Machine Records, as the follow-up to her commercially successful 2010 album Speak Now. It was announced through Swift\'s live webchat on August 13, 2012, in which she revealed the album title, album cover, as well as answered fan questions. Four promotional singles were released in the month leading up to the album release, three of which debuted inside the top ten of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The album features collaborations with new producers and guest artists such as Gary Lightbody and Ed Sheeran, and sees Swift experimenting with new musical genres.\n\nThe album\'s lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" was a worldwide commercial success, topping the iTunes charts all over the world and sold 623,000 copies in the first week, becoming Swift\'s first ever Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper after vaulting from 72 to number one and stayed at top for three weeks. Even though she usually doesn\'t discuss who her songs are about, Swift told Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard that she would agree to disclose the inspiration for "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" for a six figure donation to charity. Following in the footsteps of one of her idol\'s, whom she mimics quite often, Carly Simon.\n\nThe second single, "Begin Again" was released in October 1. Red has also spawned three other promotional singles, all of them reached top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Red has been mostly acclaimed by music critics, who praised Swift\'s versatility as a musician and enjoyed her experiments with new music genres. Red sold 1,208,000 copies in its first week in the U.S, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and scored the highest number one debut in the US for the 2010s decade so far. Red is also Swift\'s first chart-topper in the U.K., and also topped the album charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/Red">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Twin Fantasy is the sixth album by American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Will Toledo under the Car Seat Headrest moniker. Originally released on November 2nd, 2011, the album was recorded entirely by Toledo during his first semester at The College of William and Mary, inspired by a relationship the 19-year-old was in at the time. In subsequent years, Twin Fantasy would go on to become a cult hit, gaining traction through internet forums like 4chan and Reddit.\n\nOn February 16th 2018, Car Seat Headrest, now a full band, released a fully re-recorded and re-worked version of the album, entitled Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), with the original now retitled to Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror). In an interview with Peyton Thomas, Toledo noted that he had been planning to revisit the material for years, originally wanting to record the album in a studio, but having lacked the budget, resources and time. When asked about what informed the differences between the two, Toledo specified, "I spent time with different people, doing different things, and my understanding of my own life has changed. I don’t want to dismiss the things that were important to me in the past, but I want to reconcile them with how I’m living now." The re-recording was met with universal acclaim from critics upon release. \n\nBoth versions of the album are available through Matador Records and the official Car Seat Headrest Bandcamp. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Car+Seat+Headrest/Twin+Fantasy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Pitchfork wrote that "Similar to their Providence art-metal contemporaries in the Body, Daughters’ accessibility is directly proportional to their uncompromising compositional choices—hypnotic dissonance, martial drums cranked to incapacitating volumes, scathing vocal repetition, all rendered through impossibly vivid production. This is not music interesting in growing on you: it consumes and dominates." PopMatters called it "the perfect return for Daughters. While aspects of the band\'s creative vision have been altered and their sound has further evolved, the core elements remain intact. The asphyxiating sound has been augmented with the inclusion of longer, heavier sludge influenced moments. The tension the band build is further explored through different means."\n\nCredits (adapted from liner notes):\n\nAll lyrics written by Alexis Marshall; all music composed by Nick Sadler.\n\nDaughters: \nAlexis S.F.

            'The mixtape was released for free on April 25, 2011 through the group\'s official website, thirdworlds.net. It was simultaneously released through iTunes. The track "Guillotine" was released through iTunes on August 3, 2011. "Guillotine" has become the band\'s most recognized song, with over one million YouTube views on their music video as of October 2, 2012. Other tracks released as music videos include "Known For It", "Culture Shock", "Lord of the Game", "Spread Eagle Cross the Block", "Takyon (Death Yon)", and "Beware".\n\nThe cover of the album is somewhat of a mystery, even to members of the band. According to Flatlander, "That’s a photograph that one of our members carried in their wallet for roughly 10 years straight. It’s a power object." This suggests that the image had no personal meaning to any of the members of the band, but was rather an artifact that ended up being an image that they defined themselves by to some degree. There has been speculations by fans of the band that the man on the cover of the album is an aboriginal Australian man and that the photograph could have originated from a National Geographic article, though this is widely based on speculation.\n\nThe album was later released exclusively through the band\'s website in vinyl and cassette format.  It was also removed from iTunes. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Death+Grips/Exmilitary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "To Pimp a Butterfly is the third studio album by American hip hop artist, Kendrick Lamar. The album was released on March 16, 2015, by Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and distributed by Interscope Records. Upon its release, To Pimp a Butterfly received rave reviews from music critics. Lamar has described the album, which incorporates elements of funk, spoken word poetry and jazz, as \"honest, fearful and unapologetic.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Kendrick indicated that the title was a play on Harper Lee's novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. He was quoted as saying, \"Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'… It's a trip. That's something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses — I truly believe that.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of hundreds of reviews from music critics, the album has an average score of 96, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop gave it a perfect score, making it the third 10/10 he's given to a contemporary album. On music-reviewing website Rate Your Music, To Pimp A Butterfly has reached spot #13 on the list of the highest reviewed albums on the site. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/To+Pimp+a+Butterfly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Spirit of Eden is the fourth album by the English New wave band Talk Talk, released in 1988 on Parlophone records. The album found neither critical acclaim nor commercial success on release but has since become a cult favourite.\n\nThe songs were mostly written by vocalist Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene and the album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London\'s Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances which were heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format. The songs contain elements of rock, jazz, classical and ambient music.\n\nCritics often view Spirit of Eden as a departure from Talk Talk\'s earlier and more accessible albums. Compared to their 1986 hit The Colour of Spring, it was a commercial disappointment. However a plurality of critical reviews laud the album.\n\nTalk Talk, led by singer Mark Hollis, formed in England in the early 1980s. From the start, Hollis cited jazz and classical artists like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Béla Bartók and Claude Debussy as major influences. But Talk Talk\'s first two albums, The Party\'s Over (1982) and It\'s My Life (1984), did not readily reflect such influences; critics compared the band to contemporary new wave groups, especially Duran Duran. Hollis partly attributes the shortcomings of their early music to a financial need to use synthesizers in place of acoustic instruments.\n\nAlthough critics did not favour the band\'s early output, the first two albums were commercially successful in Europe. This gave Talk Talk the money needed to hire additional musicians to play on their next album, The Colour of Spring (1986). The band no longer had to rely on synthesizers. Instead, musicians improvised with their instruments for many hours, then Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene edited and arranged the performances to get the sound they wanted. A total of sixteen musicians appeared on the album. The Colour of Spring became Talk Talk\'s most successful album, selling over two million copies and prompting a major world tour. At the same time, minimalist songs like "April 5th," "Chameleon Day," and the B-side "It\'s Getting Late in the Evening" pointed towards the band\'s next direction.\n\nFor the success of The Colour of Spring, EMI rewarded Talk Talk with an open budget and schedule for the recording of their next album, Spirit of Eden. Talk Talk were given complete control over the recording process; their manager and EMI executives were barred from studio sessions. Recording for Spirit of Eden began in 1987 at Wessex Studios, London and took about a year to complete.\n\nEngineer Phill Brown said that the album, along with its successor, was "recorded by chance, accident, and hours of trying every possible overdub idea."\n\nAlthough the album is noted for its tranquil soundscapes, Graham Sutton of Bark Psychosis notes "Noise is important. I could never understand people I knew who liked Talk Talk and saw it as something \'nice to chill out to\' when I loved the overwhelming intensity and the dynamics."\n\nMark Hollis\' lyrics reflect his religious and spiritual outlook. Though he acknowledges that his lyrics are religious, he says they are not based on a specific creed, preferring to think of them as "humanitarian."\n"I Believe in You" has been described as an "anti-heroin song." When asked whether the lyrics are based on personal experience, Hollis replied, "No, not at all. But, you know, I met people who got totally fucked up on it. Within rock music there\'s so much fucking glorification of it, and it is a wicked, horrible thing."\n\nSome music critics consider Spirit of Eden and its 1991 follow-up Laughing Stock influential to post-rock, a music genre that developed in Britain and North America in the 1990s. In a review of Bark Psychosis\' album Hex, where the term "post-rock" was coined, Simon Reynolds opined that Hex aspires to the "baroque grandeur" of Spirit of Eden. Andy Whitman of Paste magazine argues that Spirit of Eden represents the beginning of post-rock: "The telltale marks of the genre—textured guitars, glacial tempos, an emphasis on dynamics, electronica, ambience and minimalism—were all in place, and paved the way for bands like Sigur Rós, Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Low and latter-period Radiohead." Simon Harper of the Birmingham Post observed how "their combination of jazz, classical, rock and the spacey echoes of dub, using silence almost as an instrument in its own right, lends itself to the vernacular of post-rock, and there can be little argument that Tortoise and their Chicago-based compatriots would hardly sound the same were it not for the staggering achievements of Hollis and Tim Friese-Greene." Numerous bands and artists, including Graham Coxon, Doves and Elbow have praised Spirit of Eden or have cited it as an influence.\n\nIn 2008 Alan McGee wrote: "Spirit of Eden has not dated; it\'s remarkable how contemporary it sounds, anticipating post-rock, The Verve and Radiohead. It\'s the sound of an artist being given the keys to the kingdom and returning with art."\n\nAll songs written and composed by Tim Friese-Greene and Mark Hollis. \n\n1. "The Rainbow"   9:05\n2.

            'Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth album by British rock band The Beatles. It was recorded with breaks from the end of 1966 to the middle of 1967 and published on June 14, 1967. The producer was George Martin, and the studio engineer was Geoff Emerick. Most critics agree with the choice of "Rolling Stone" magazine, according to which this is the greatest rock album of all time. This album also has the most famous cover in rock history.\n\nReleased on 26 May 1967, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the Record Retailer chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the United States. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in songwriting, production, and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. Its release was a defining moment in 1960s pop culture, heralding the Summer of Love, while the album\'s reception achieved full cultural legitimation for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form.\n\nAt the end of August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired by the Beatles\' youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP.\n\nThe album was loosely conceptualized as a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was conceived after recording the title track. A key work of British psychedelia, it incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. The band continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, the group colored much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" and "A Day in the Life". The recording was completed on 21 April. The pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth designed the cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures.\n\nMusicologists regard Sgt. Pepper was an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular music. The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones of the era\'s youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. It is considered one of the first art rock LPs, a progenitor to progressive rock, and the start of the album era. In 1968, it won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honor; in 2003, the Library of Congress inducted it into the National Recording Registry. It has topped several critics\' and listeners\' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by Rolling Stone magazine and in the book All-Time Top 1000 Albums, and the UK\'s "Music of the Millennium" poll. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time and the UK\'s best-selling studio album, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011.\n\nThe beginning of the psychedelic era:\nAfter giving up the rock tour in August 1966, the Beatles\' popularity began to decline sharply, and the media began to speculate that the band had "dried up" under the onslaught of a new generation of rock artists, primarily genre-oriented psychedelic rock. A type of rock and roll that is produced under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, primarily LSD.\n\nThe Beatles have used these drugs before, but their impact on their music has not been overly pronounced (except for a few songs from the Revolver album, including the group\'s first psychedelic song, Tomorrow Never Knows). In February 1967, at the urging of manager Brian Epstein, the Beatles released the single Strawberry Fields Forever / Penny Lane, with songs originally planned for their next LP album. The single took second place on the charts and after several years; it was characterized as a failure. However, after this, the group did not leave the studio for several months.\n\nStudy work:\nWith the permission of producer George Martin to use certain amounts of drugs in the studio, the Beatles were led by Paul McCartney for the first time, because the former frontman, John Lennon, was depressed due to family problems. McCartney was the author of most of the songs on the album (including the title songs), however, Lennon also significantly contributed to this project with songs such as Being for Benefits of Mr. Kite and A Day in the Life, part of which was recorded by McCartney for his own song, but Martin added it to Lennon. All the songs of these two were later, by an earlier agreement, marked traditionally - Lennon / McCartney, but each author is the lead vocalist in his song, except in the case of the song "With a Little Help of My Friends", sung by the drummer, Ringo Starr. As for the studio technique, the previous 4-channel recording machine, ADT (Auto Double-Tracking) machine for doubling one\'s voice was used. In the coming period, this machine will be more and more popular, as the individuality of the members grows in the group, who will want to record most or even their entire songs on their own.\n\nCover:\nAccording to various sources, the cover was also McCartney\'s idea. The Beatles, in guard uniforms, with wind instruments, for the first time with a mustache and beard, are an integral part of all versions of this album. However, in the American edition, that is where it all ends, because there is only a yellow wall behind the group. In the British (European) edition, behind the "Beatles" there is a bunch of people, important in the then and past time - among them are Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Marilyn Monroe, ... However, the "Beatles" themselves with the look of before this album. Also, below the members of the group is a floral decor with the inscription "The Beatles". An album like this was a lure for many conspiracy theorists, so this is also one of the most mysterious covers of all time.\n\nThe final concept:\nThe whole album is connected by one theme, which was a kind of precedent and thus the "Beatles" became the creators of the so-called "Concept album". The protagonist of the story in question is a certain Billy Shears (when, thanks to the fact that he lent his voice in the song "With a Little Help of My Friends", interpreted by Ringo Starr), who modestly announces a performance after the pompous performance of the Sergeant Pepper Club more "lonely hearts", claiming that "a little help from a friend" is enough for him after a hard day. Then, in the following songs, the Beatles comment on various existential problems - from a normal working day ("Good Morning, Good Morning"), old age ("When I\'m 64") to death itself and the problems around it ("Lucy in the Sky With Diamond ”, whose initial letters of the word, by the way, give the name of the drug LSD). The album closes with a slightly modified ("reprise") version of the first song, which builds on the last, "bis" song - "A Day in the Life". The whole album is accompanied by studio applause from the audience and applause.\n\nAfter publication\nThe album was a great success and many still consider it the most successful LP of the group. He received positive criticism even from critics of classical music when Lennon and McCartney were compared to Shostakovich and proclaimed the greatest composers in the period after Beethoven. The group vowed not to use narcotics anymore, as it found its new inner peace in a new spiritual, Indian leader, Maharishi-Mash Yogi, who is the creator of transcendental meditation. It is certain, however, that all members continued to use drugs. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Sgt.+Pepper%27s+Lonely+Hearts+Club+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
