            'The mixtape was released for free on April 25, 2011 through the group\'s official website, thirdworlds.net. It was simultaneously released through iTunes. The track "Guillotine" was released through iTunes on August 3, 2011. "Guillotine" has become the band\'s most recognized song, with over one million YouTube views on their music video as of October 2, 2012. Other tracks released as music videos include "Known For It", "Culture Shock", "Lord of the Game", "Spread Eagle Cross the Block", "Takyon (Death Yon)", and "Beware".\n\nThe cover of the album is somewhat of a mystery, even to members of the band. According to Flatlander, "That’s a photograph that one of our members carried in their wallet for roughly 10 years straight. It’s a power object." This suggests that the image had no personal meaning to any of the members of the band, but was rather an artifact that ended up being an image that they defined themselves by to some degree. There has been speculations by fans of the band that the man on the cover of the album is an aboriginal Australian man and that the photograph could have originated from a National Geographic article, though this is widely based on speculation.\n\nThe album was later released exclusively through the band\'s website in vinyl and cassette format.  It was also removed from iTunes. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Death+Grips/Exmilitary">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'You Won\'t Get What You Want is the fourth studio album by American rock band Daughters. It was released on October 26, 2018, through Ipecac Recordings. It is the band\'s first album since they broke up in late 2009. The album was released to universal critical acclaim, with many critics naming it one of the best albums of 2018. It marks a significant departure from the band\'s earlier style, moving away from mathcore towards a more industrial and noise rock influenced sound.\n\nThe album was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 87, based on 11 reviews, which indicates "universal acclaim". The album was included on numerous end-of-year lists as one of the best albums of 2018. Pitchfork wrote that "Similar to their Providence art-metal contemporaries in the Body, Daughters’ accessibility is directly proportional to their uncompromising compositional choices—hypnotic dissonance, martial drums cranked to incapacitating volumes, scathing vocal repetition, all rendered through impossibly vivid production. This is not music interesting in growing on you: it consumes and dominates." PopMatters called it "the perfect return for Daughters. While aspects of the band\'s creative vision have been altered and their sound has further evolved, the core elements remain intact. The asphyxiating sound has been augmented with the inclusion of longer, heavier sludge influenced moments. The tension the band build is further explored through different means."\n\nCredits (adapted from liner notes):\n\nAll lyrics written by Alexis Marshall; all music composed by Nick Sadler.\n\nDaughters: \nAlexis S.F.

            'Swans’ previous album, 2012’s ‘The Seer’ (Spotlight feature), was monumental, a behemoth of bleakness and self-flagellation, a meditation on the sublime from which these songs were directly born.\n\nA harsher parent is hard to imagine, but while its progeny hasn’t fallen far from the tree, ‘To Be Kind’ is altogether more colourful, an expansive record – fleshier, bloodier and lusciously psychedelic.\n\nWhere ‘The Seer’ gazed deep into the void, this sets its sights on the stars. It’s ‘kosmische musik’ in every sense, utilising the talents of several guest musicians, labelmate Cold Specks, previous collaborator Little Annie and the imperious St Vincent. \n\n‘Screen Shot’ is a cyclical, insistent opening, hypnotic and distant. A sinister tribute to Howlin’ Wolf, ‘Just A Little Boy (For Chester Burnett)’, is Delta blues through a David Lynch filter: dirty, disconcerting and darkly feral. \n\nThe sickly, influenza-wheezing funk of ‘A Little God In My Hands’ (below) is a relative breeze at just over seven minutes. It’s a breather before ‘Bring The Sun’: an epic sonic baptism of shamanistic, trance-inducing, ‘Ummagumma’-era Pink Floyd instrumentation and cacophonous incantation.\n\nThe call-to-arms of ‘Toussaint L’Ouverture’, named after the Haitian revolutionary, is a brutal yet buoyant celebration, while the lean ‘Oxygen’ is super tight, a funk-based post-rock propulsion of big ballooning sound punctuated by brass. Later, ‘Nathalie Neal’ is a haunting mélange of vibraphones and spoken-word.\n\nFrontman Michael Gira’s ever-abstract lyrics give plenty of room for interpretation throughout. Imagine Karlheinz Stockhausen’s jarring classicism, Captain Beefheart\'s twisted blues, and the industrialism of Einstürzende Neubauten coalescing into a swirling musical miasma. Near perfection.\n\n9/10\n\nWords: Anna Wilson <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Swans/To+Be+Kind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'All My Heroes Are Cornballs, released September 13, 2019, is JPEGMAFIA’s third studio album, following up his critically-acclaimed 2018 sophomore album, Veteran.\n\nPeggy released the album’s title and release date on August 28, 2019 through an Instagram post featuring clips of all of those who have listened to bits of the record.\n\nThe first single from the album, “Jesus Forgive Me, I Am a Thot,” was released on August 13, 2019, along with an accompanying music video.\n\nThe second single from the record, “Beta Male Strategies,” was released on September 10th, 2019.\n\nPeggy showed this project to multiple artists before its release, with Injury Reserve and producer Kenny Beats being some of them. On August 18, 2019, Peggy released a YouTube video showing him playing some of the project to Kenny, showing him the record’s debut single and previewing a remix of a freestyle the two made on Kenny’s YouTube show The Cave. In this video, Peggy also revealed a bit about the creation of the track list for this record. When Kenny asked about how many tracks he made for the record, Peggy said:\n\nI made 93 songs for this piece of shit right quick… I meant to make 89, but I accidentally made four more… [89] because that’s my birth year and just an arbitrary number.\n\nPeggy then released a video on August 25, 2019 of him previewing portions of the record to producer DJ Dahi, teasing a cover that may appear on the record and a track tentatively called “PTSD.”\n\nThen, in an Instagram post releasing the record’s release date and title on August 28th, 2019, Peggy showed that past collaborators Flume and Channel Tres, all listened to the record in advance as well.\n\nPeggy released a fourth video of him previewing the record to Jeff Tweedy and comedian Hannibal Buress on September 1st, 2019, previewing an untitled “Track 3”, now known to be “Beta Male Strategies.”\n\nThe album’s track listing and cover art were revealed when the record was put up for pre-order on September 6th, 2019, seven days before its release.\n\nOn September 8th, 2019, JPEGMAFIA released a video of him previewing the record James Blake, who was previously shown in the album’s teaser video, continuing showing previews of “Beta Male Strategies.” <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/JPEGMAFIA/All+My+Heroes+Are+Cornballs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'With Teens of Denial, his first real “studio” album with an actual band, Will Toledo moves from bedroom pop to something approaching classic rock grandeur and huge (if detailed and personal) narrative ambitions, with nods to the Cars, Pavement, Jonathan Richman, Wire, and William Onyeabor. Teens of Denial refracts Toledo’s particular, personal story of one difficult year through cultural touchstones such as the biography of Frank Sinatra, the evolution of the Me Generation as seen in Mad Men and elsewhere, plus elements of eastern and western theology. The whole thing flaunts a kind of conceptual, lyrical, and musical ambition that has been missing from far too much 21st-century music. Horns, keyboards, and elegant instrumental interludes set off art-garage moments; vivid vocal harmonies follow punk frenzy. The selfish captain of the capsized cruise liner in the Mediterranean in 2013 becomes a metaphor for struggles of the individual in society, as experienced by one hungover young man on the verge of adulthood. The album was produced by Steve Fisk (Nirvana, Beat Happening, Soundgarden) at his studio in Seattle, July-September 2015. This is the first full album of new music from Car Seat Headrest released on Matador. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Car+Seat+Headrest/Teens+Of+Denial">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Twin Fantasy is the sixth album by American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Will Toledo under the Car Seat Headrest moniker. Originally released on November 2nd, 2011, the album was recorded entirely by Toledo during his first semester at The College of William and Mary, inspired by a relationship the 19-year-old was in at the time. In subsequent years, Twin Fantasy would go on to become a cult hit, gaining traction through internet forums like 4chan and Reddit.\n\nOn February 16th 2018, Car Seat Headrest, now a full band, released a fully re-recorded and re-worked version of the album, entitled Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), with the original now retitled to Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror). In an interview with Peyton Thomas, Toledo noted that he had been planning to revisit the material for years, originally wanting to record the album in a studio, but having lacked the budget, resources and time. When asked about what informed the differences between the two, Toledo specified, "I spent time with different people, doing different things, and my understanding of my own life has changed. I don’t want to dismiss the things that were important to me in the past, but I want to reconcile them with how I’m living now." The re-recording was met with universal acclaim from critics upon release. \n\nBoth versions of the album are available through Matador Records and the official Car Seat Headrest Bandcamp. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Car+Seat+Headrest/Twin+Fantasy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Chemtrails Over the Country Club is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey. It was released on March 19, 2021 by Interscope Records and Polydor Records.

A cover of Joni Mitchell\'s 1970 song "For Free", featuring American singer-songwriters Zella Day and Weyes Blood, is included in the album.\n\nIn a September 2020 interview with Interview magazine, Del Rey stated that "so much of the album" pertains to her "stunning girlfriends" and "beautiful siblings". A February 2021 interview with Del Rey, for the April 2021 issue of music magazine Mojo, stated "In 2021, [[i]Chemtrails over the Country Club] opens a sunnier chapter in [Del Rey\'s] controversial roman-à-clef, and folk legend Joan Baez advocates her acceptance in the pantheon", adding that the album "appears to reveal a more vulnerable Del Rey" who is "lighter on the LA menace" and "more innocently emotional" than in her previous work. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/Chemtrails+Over+the+Country+Club">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'OK Computer is the third album by the English rock band Radiohead, released in 1997. It reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart and marked Radiohead\'s highest entry into the American market at the time, where it debuted at #21. OK Computer expanded the band\'s worldwide popularity, becoming the last Radiohead album to have a delayed release outside of the United Kingdom. As of 2007, it has been certified triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. OK Computer included the singles "Paranoid Android", "Karma Police" and "No Surprises".\n\nThe album was recorded in rural Oxfordshire and Bath, England with Nigel Godrich, who would work with the band on all their future recordings. Although OK Computer was dominated by guitar, its expansive sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time, laying the groundwork for Radiohead\'s later, more experimental work. The lyrics, by Thom Yorke, and the album\'s artwork by Yorke and frequent collaborator Stanley Donwood, emphasised themes such as consumerism, social disconnection, political stagnation and modern malaise, though the band denied they set out to make a concept album.\n\n\nUpon its release, OK Computer received almost unanimously positive reviews. Consensus among critics was that the album was a landmark of its time and would have far-reaching impact and importance. NME gave the album a ten out of ten score, and reviewer James Oldham wrote "Here are 12 tracks crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that refuse to retread the successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation and surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of one man without ever considering sacrifice or surrender. In short, here is a landmark record of the 1990s, and one that deserves your attention more than any other released this year." Taylor Parkes of Melody Maker connected the album\'s release to the era\'s feeling of paranoia and alienation about millenarianism, and said "It\'s as pained and as slow-moving as the emotions that inspired it. ... In one way or another, Radiohead have excelled themselves." Q awarded the album five out of five stars, with writer David Cavanagh stating that "the majority of OK Computer\'s 12 songs ... takes place in a queer old landscape: unfamiliar and ominous, but also beautiful and unspoiled. ... It\'s a huge, mysterious album for the head and soul." Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that "Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years time I\'m betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era." In a four out of five stars review, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that the album "is surprising and sometimes inspiring but its intensity makes for a demanding listen."\n\nThe album was also favourably received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars. Reviewer Mark Kemp wrote that the album is "a stunning art-rock tour de force ... On OK Computer, Radiohead take the ideas they had begun toying with on The Bends into the stratosphere. ... OK Computer is evidence that Radiohead are one rock band still willing to look the devil square in the eyes", but warned "OK Computer is not an easy listen." An Entertainment Weekly review by David Browne gave the album a B+, and wrote that "When the arrangements and lyrics meander or sprout pretensions, the album grows ponderous and soggy. For all of Radiohead\'s growing pains, though, their aim — to take British pop to a heavenly new level — is true." In an article for The New Yorker, writer Alex Ross praised OK Computer for its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead\'s risk-taking with the more musically conservative "dadrock" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote that "Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme  This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock." Ryan Schreiber wrote, in a highly enthusiastic ten out of ten review in his online music magazine Pitchfork, that "Radiohead\'s third piece of incredible work, OK Computer, is not only their best yet, but one of the year\'s greatest releases. The record is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing."\n\nDespite OK Computer\'s widespread praise, it also received some criticism. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice granted OK Computer a B− but ranked it as the "Dud of the Month" in his consumer guide; Christgau commented that the album lacked "soul", calling it "arid" and "ridiculous" and comparing it unfavourably to Pink Floyd. Andy Gill wrote for The Independent in an otherwise positive review, "For all its ambition, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that so luxuriates in its despondency". While a review in Time was largely positive, particularly praising the songs "Airbag", "Paranoid Android", and "Let Down", reviewer Christopher John Farley criticised the second half of the album. Farley stated, "While the first half-dozen tracks reward repeated listenings with melodies that grow and bloom with familiarity, there is often no structure to be found in the remaining half-dozen numbers."\n\nAt the end of 1997, OK Computer appeared in many critics\' lists and listener polls for best album of the year. OK Computer topped the year-end polls of the magazines Mojo, Vox, Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly, and Inpress, and tied for first place with Daft Punk\'s Homework in The Face. The album placed second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and Uncut. Q and Les Inrockuptibles both listed OK Computer in their unranked year-end polls. OK Computer was a nominee for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognizing the best British or Irish album of the year. The album was nominated in the Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the latter award.\n\nOK Computer first appeared in a "best of all time" list three months after its release, placing 16 in a chart based on submissions by customers of Virgin Megastores. This chart heavily favoured recent releases, which suggested that OK Computer\'s popularity was a passing fad. However, OK Computer has since appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. In early 1998, OK Computer topped a Q reader\'s poll of the greatest albums of all time, and in 2001 Q placed it at number one in a list of the top 50 pop albums of the last 15 years. A number of publications, including NME, Melody Maker, Spin, Alternative Press, Pitchfork Media, and Time placed OK Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Additionally, retrospective reviews from The A.V. Club and Slant Magazine have received the album favourably; likewise, Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying "Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering."\n\n\nOK Computer was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election. It was thus seen by critics as encompassing public opinion through its "despairing-yet-hopeful tone" and themes of alienation. Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by reading a book about the two decades of Conservative government which were just coming to an end in 1997, as well as about factory farming and globalisation. However, in interviews Yorke expressed little hope things would change under the "New Labour" government of Tony Blair. With the approach of the year 2000, many people felt the tone of the album was millennial.\n\nSome critics have credited OK Computer with "killing" 1990s Britpop, as within a few years of its release, the dominant style of UK guitar pop had become slower and more melancholy. Many of the newer acts used similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements. The band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The Man Who, which became the biggest selling album of 1999 in the UK. Others have credited Radiohead with beginning a mainstream revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, though the band denied their affiliation with the genre. Radiohead described the prevalence of bands that "sound like us" as one reason to break with the style of OK Computer for their next album, Kid A. When asked by MTV interviewer Gideon Yago what the band thought of "bands like Travis, Coldplay, and Muse ... making a career sounding exactly like Radiohead did in 1997", Yorke replied "Good luck with \'Kid A\'!".\n\nSeveral rock bands which later became popular, ranging from Coldplay and Bloc Party to TV on the Radio, have said they were formatively influenced by OK Computer—TV on the Radio\'s debut album, for instance, was titled OK Calculator. Additionally, the album\'s popularity paved the way for British alternative rock bands such as Muse, Snow Patrol, and Keane. Classical and jazz musicians such as Christopher O\'Riley and Brad Mehldau have performed material from OK Computer, and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said "When I heard \'OK Computer,\' after five minutes I said, \'I actually get this. I understand what these people are trying to do.\' And what they were trying was not so drastically different from what I was trying to do." Radiodread is a song for song cover of the album in a Reggae style.\n\nOK Computer has received great acclaim from the public and critics. It is often cited as Radiohead\'s best work and as a landmark album of its time. In 1998, it was nominated for a Grammy Award as Album of the Year, and won for Best Alternative Music Album. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'In Rainbows is the seventh studio album by the English alternative rock band Radiohead. It was first released on 10 October 2007 as a digital download that customers could order for whatever price they saw fit, followed by a standard CD release in most countries during the last week of 2007. The album was released in North America on 1 January 2008. In Rainbows was Radiohead\'s first release after the end of their contract with EMI and the end of the longest gap between studio albums in their career.\n\nIn Rainbows was recorded in London, Somerset, Wiltshire and Oxfordshire with producers Mark Stent and Nigel Godrich. Radiohead worked on the songs for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In between recording, the band toured Europe and North America for three months in 2006. Radiohead used a wide variety of musical styles on the album, incorporating string arrangements and electronic music, pianos, celestes and the ondes Martenot, yet renewing their focus on guitars, drums and bass as lead instruments. The songwriting on In Rainbows was more personal than that of Radiohead\'s other work, with singer Thom Yorke describing it as his attempt to write "seduction songs".\n\n Upon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the United World Chart, UK Album Chart, and the U.S. Billboard 200 at number one. In Rainbows also earned widespread critical acclaim, and several publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2007. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/In+Rainbows">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'The Bends, released on 13 March 1995 in the United Kingdom and on 4 April 1995 in the United States, is the second studio album released by the English rock band Radiohead. The album was dedicated to the late comedian Bill Hicks. The album contains singles "High and Dry", "Fake Plastic Trees", "Just", "My Iron Lung", and "Street Spirit (Fade Out)".\n\nThe Bends was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone\'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and number 2 on Q\'s 100 Greatest Albums Ever.\n\nThe album was subject to much greater critical acclaim than their debut Pablo Honey (1993), and it reached number four in the UK Albums Chart. However, it failed to build on the commercial success of their single "Creep" outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked on the American charts at number 88. Although it lacked the instant success of later Radiohead albums, The Bends achieved triple platinum sales certifications in the UK and Canada and platinum sales in the US and the EU.\n\nAccording to the band, The Bends marked the start of a gradual turn in Yorke\'s songwriting from personal angst to the more cryptic lyrics and social and global themes that would come to dominate the band\'s later work. Most of the album was seen to continue the lyrical concerns of Pablo Honey, although in more mature fashion. The songs "Fake Plastic Trees" and, in particular, "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" and its b-side "Talk Show Host", are often seen as a precursor to their next album OK Computer (1997). "Fake Plastic Trees" was partly inspired by the commercial development of Canary Wharf, while "Sulk" was written as a response to the Hungerford massacre. According to Yorke, "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" was inspired by the book The Famished Road by Ben Okri.\n\nThe lyrics to the songs on The Bends, particularly those of "My Iron Lung", were cited in the British music press as an example of Yorke\'s alleged depression. Melody Maker ran an article during The Bends period which suggested Yorke would be the next "rock \'n roll martyr" or suicide.\n\nThe Bends was the first of the band\'s full-length records with artwork by Stanley Donwood, in collaboration with Yorke, who went under the name "The White Chocolate Farm" (later shortened to Tchock). Originally Yorke had wanted to use an image of an iron lung as the cover, but he lost it. The eventual album cover was created at the last minute by morphing a photograph taken by Donwood of a medical dummy with Yorke\'s own face. It is also the last Radiohead album whose liner notes and artwork include pictures of the band members.\n\nThe Bends met with much greater critical acclaim than Pablo Honey, appearing on many end-of-year lists in 1995. Within the UK, it assured Radiohead\'s role as a standard-bearer of "indie" Brit-rock bands. The album was released during the height of the \'90s Britpop movement, benefiting from renewed press attention to British guitar music; however, in the band\'s home country, Radiohead\'s music was rarely grouped with Blur, Pulp and other so-called "Britpop" acts, instead receiving some acclaim for diverging from the fashionable aspects of the scene.\n\nIn the United States, the album eventually reached number 88 on the Billboard 200 in 1996, while the single "High and Dry" reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, The Bends reached number 4 and remains a bestseller. In mid-1995 Radiohead toured as an opening act for R.E.M., playing songs from The Bends and extending their popularity with a mass audience.\n\nThe Bends had an influence on the subsequent generation of British pop bands. In 2006, The Observer listed it as one of "the 50 albums that changed music", saying, "Radiohead\'s Thom Yorke popularised the angst-laden falsetto, a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis\'s Liam Gallagher. Singing in a higher octave-range and falsetto voice to a backdrop of churning guitars became a much-copied idea, however, one that eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound. Without this, Coldplay would not exist, nor Keane, nor James Blunt." Radiohead members said they later distanced themselves from their mid \'90s sound partly because they felt little affinity for those that adopted the sound.\n\nThe Bends took second place behind Radiohead\'s OK Computer in both 1998 and 2006 reader polls of Q magazine for the best album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone initially gave the album an average rating. In 2000, Virgin\'s Top 1000 Albums of All Time ranked The Bends at number two, second only to Revolver by The Beatles. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Merriweather Post Pavilion is the eighth studio album by American experimental pop group Animal Collective, released in January 2009 on Domino Records. It peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 and No. 2 on the US Top Independent Albums charts. According to review aggregate site Metacritic, Merriweather was the most critically acclaimed album of 2009, and went on to sell a total of 200,000 copies. It spawned the singles "My Girls" (named the Best Song of 2009 by Pitchfork and Slant Magazine), "Summertime Clothes", and "Brother Sport".\n\nThe album is named after the Columbia, Maryland venue, Merriweather Post Pavilion. A plan to perform at Merriweather Post Pavilion after the album\'s release in 2009 was ultimately discarded, though the band eventually did perform there on July 9, 2011.\n\nAfter recording Strawberry Jam in January 2007, guitarist Deakin (Josh Dibb) decided he would take time off from the group for undisclosed personal reasons. As a result, the group went about writing a new batch of songs to be played without guitar. Drawing inspiration from Panda Bear\'s Person Pitch, the band used samplers as its primary instruments. The group debuted nine of these songs, most of which would later appear on the album, in May 2007 and toured with them through 2008. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective/Merriweather+Post+Pavilion">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Sung Tongs is the fifth album by Baltimore-based band Animal Collective, released on May 3, 2004 by Fat Cat Records.\n\nDespite the name \'Animal Collective\' attached to this album, only two of the band\'s four members play on it: Avey Tare (David Portner) and Panda Bear (Noah Lennox). As a result, Sung Tongs is a more stripped-down affair than other Animal Collective releases. On the album, Portner and Lennox both utilize acoustic guitars and tribal-like drums; the electric guitar, an important element in the Collective\'s previous album, Here Comes the Indian, is nowhere to be found. This sound brought the band closer to the psych folk and freak folk genres that critics tended to group them in around this period.\n\nSung Tongs is generally considered to be Animal Collective\'s breakthrough release; it generated much praise from critics upon its release and was frequently featured in best-of lists at the end of 2004.\n\nRecording\nOn the Collected Animals message board, Portner talks about the recording equipment:\n\n"Yeah, we recorded it on the same tascam 48 (half inch 8 track) that I recorded Spirit They\'re Gone, Spirit They\'ve Vanished on and the drums guitars and early electronics for Danse Manatee. That is we recorded the acoustic guitars and the vocals on 8 tracks. Then we mixed it down on Rusty\'s laptop and recorded many vocal and percussion over dubs. He\'s been using that for years. We mixed it from that onto....something..(i cant remember) at Noah\'s mom\'s place in Baltimore. It was very cold so we had to wear jackets the whole time. We added in all those samples and electronics there. We mixed for awhile so its sweet you like the mixing. Oh and we used AKGs and an old ribbon mike to record with. Though we had a pzm and some sm57s that we might have used as well. I remember using the pzm to record me slamming the door of the house which is what that distorted rhythm track in kids on holiday is. The person talking at the beginning of Who Could Win A Rabbit is someone in a deli in my neighborhood."\n\nMoreover, they used exclusively red light during the recording process. Portner explains at the same place:\n\n"Lots of singing and messing around with doing vocals in all parts of a room. It was basically like a two bedroom house but the living room was all cement...thats where we recorded and the bedroom was where we set up the mixer. Its on the property that my parents live on in lamar colorado. We rented a bunch of mikes here in nyc and took my eight track out there with us. Rusty [Santos] would just listen to every song as we would play it live and walk around the room for a while and then decide how he\'d want to mike the guitars. Noah and i both did the percussion during over dubs throughout the session as well."\n\nTrivia\nThe short track College with its line "You don\'t have to go to college" has often been mistaken as a political statement. "i just threw that line in there to make it funny and to be anti beachboys cause the song is so beach boys to begin with. You know its like the anti..be true to your school mentality of the fifties.", Dave Portner (aka Avey Tare) explained on the Collected Animals message board." The response to that song has been amazing. People at gigs scream for us to play it, and we get emails from kids asking for advice", Portner said in an Interview in 2005.\n\nThe song Visiting Friends was influenced by Kompakt’s Pop Ambient compilations and Wolfgang Voigt’s project Gas. It was meant to be "like a wall of hums [...], but with acoustic guitars."\n\nRecalling the recordings of the album\'s single  Who Could Win a Rabbit, Portner wrote on the Collected Animals Board: "The first time we played back who could win a rabbit after we recorded the initial tracks we just cracked up and said \'holy shit, we made that????....\' " <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective/Sung+Tongs">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Strawberry Jam is the seventh studio album by Baltimore based band Animal Collective. It was released on September 11, 2007, and is the band\'s first release for Domino Records. The title and track listing were revealed by band member Geologist on the Collected Animals message board on May 16, 2007. The press response to Strawberry Jam was mostly positive, with some lauding its unique sound as a large step forward in the band\'s evolution. The album charted on the Billboard Top 200, debuting and peaking at #72.\n\nStrawberry Jam was released on iTunes with an exclusive live version of "Cuckoo Cuckoo", the video for "Peacebone", and a digital reproduction of the album\'s booklet.\n\nRecording\nThe Album was recorded at Wave Lab Studios in Tucson, Arizona. Band member Brian Weitz explained why they chose this location on the Collected Animals message board:\n\n"dave [Portner] and i were talking a few months back about environments to record and one of us was like maybe it\'d be sweet to make this next one a desert record and then everyone was like yeah man we haven\'t done that yet and it seems like it could fit the songs and the way we want them to sound. that might not make sense to anyone but us because when you think of the desert you think of twangy guitars and morricone soundtracks and jim morrison walking with the ghost of an indian, but we don\'t really see it that way. we looked at a bunch of studios from southern california to new mexico and settled on one we liked in tucson. plus i\'ve spent about a year and a half of my life living in the tucson area"\n\nMoreover, Strawberry Jam engineer Scott Colburn, who also worked with the band to record the predecessor Feels, knew Wave Lab\'s owner. According to member Noah Lennox, it was a conscious decision to record the album "in a desert setting."\n\nAlbum content\nIn a pre-release interview with Billboard, guitarist Deakin described the new album as "chiseled" and "shiver-inducing". According to the interview, the majority of the album\'s songs were played on the band\'s live shows from 2005 to 2006, but that there would be, "nonetheless, a few new ones that we\'ve never played live."\n\nTwo songs that had been played extensively on the band\'s 2005–2006 concerts, "Safer" and "Street Flash", were not included on Strawberry Jam. Regarding the songs\' absences, singer and guitarist Avey Tare wrote to fans that the band recorded studio versions for both, but decided against including them on the album, "partially due to their length(s)". "Safer" was eventually released as the B-side of the album\'s first single, "Peacebone", while "Street Flash" and other studio leftovers appeared on the 2008 EP Water Curses.\n\nTitle and cover art\nThe name Strawberry Jam came from singer and drummer Panda Bear as he and the band were on a plane headed to Greece for a show. Upon receiving his complimentary tray of food, he opened up the packet of strawberry jam that had been provided for the bread. As he removed the cover of the packet, he was drawn to the look of the glistening jam, and he expressed his desire for the production of their new album to sound like the jam looked, "that is to say, something that\'s really synthetic and sharp and futuristic looking," but also "tangy and sweet, almost in a kind of aggressive way in terms of the way it tastes".\n\nAvey Tare created and photographed the cover art. Additional layout and design was done by Rob Carmichael, with whom Animal Collective has collaborated on several other projects.\n\nInternet leak\nThe album\'s internet leak on June 12, 2007, was notable in that it was leaked in three song clusters over a period of weeks. Geologist wrote on the Collected Animals board that the first batch of promotional copies were watermarked, and that each journalist\'s name would be digitally embedded in any extracted files. On June 19, 2007, a letter from the band\'s publicist was sent to music journalists regarding the leaking of the first three songs:\n\nLast week three tracks from Animal Collective\'s new album leaked. Within minutes we were able to track the leak to a writer\'s CD. That person got in more trouble than you care to hear about and was almost fired. The person was also forced to write an apology letter to an entire staff of people and the head of Domino Records along with other penance.\n\n\nPanda Bear talked with Shout Mouth regarding the band\'s thoughts on the leak:\n\nThe only thing we’re really upset about with the leak is that it’s only parts of it. I think there are six songs out there now. People aren’t even able to get the full experience of the album, which bums us all out quite a bit. So if you’re listening leakers [speaking directly into the tape recorder], put up those other three songs, man, pronto.\nThe remaining three tracks - "Fireworks", "Cuckoo Cuckoo" and "Derek" - were all leaked on July 4, 2007. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective/Strawberry+Jam">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

"Edit the Sad Parts" was later included on Interstate 8 and the Up Records compilation, US, while "A Manic Depressive Named Laughing Boy" remains available only on the vinyl edition. Many of the tracks focus on traveling by automobile, and the loneliness and isolation associated with rural life. Sad Sappy Sucker was supposed to be released before This Is A Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About; however, it was delayed and shelved. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Modest+Mouse/This+Is+a+Long+Drive+for+Someone+with+Nothing+to+Think+About">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Stankonia is the fourth studio album by American hip hop duo OutKast, released October 31, 2000 on La Face Records. The album debuted at number 2 on the U.S. Billboard  200 chart, selling over 530,000 copies the first week. Stankonia  received universal acclaim from most music critics, based on an aggregate score of 95/100 from Metacritic. It received rave reviews from publications such as USA Today and the Los Angeles Times. It was also voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll. In 2003, the album was ranked number 359 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nStank, a commonly used word on the album, is derived from a southern U.S. pronunciation of stink, the original meaning of the word funk. George Clinton applied the term stank to the more carnal, hedonistic things in life, including funk music. "Stankonia" is the name of a fictional land at "the center of the earth, seven light years below sea level", which is "the place from which all \'funky thangs\' come", according to the album\'s opening lyrics. The lyrical content is divided between verses from Big Boi and André 3000. The artists describe themselves as "a player and a poet", respectively, and this is reflected in the lyrics; Big Boi tends to deal with standard gangsta fare (such as guns, hoes, and pimping on songs such as "Snappin & Trappin" and "We Luv Deez Hoez") while André 3000 talks about other elements of "stanking", using metaphors  about elephants, ski slopes, and the four humours.\n\nPart of the reason for Stankonia\'s acclaim and popularity was the diversity of its musical influences, which led to comparisons to Prince. It incorporates many musical genres to create a unique-sounding whole. For example, the album opens with Indian tablas and harmonium, then launching into a heavy metal-style electric guitar riff on "Gasoline Dreams" before turning to slick P-funk on the second song (fourth track overall) "So Fresh, So Clean". The album also incorporates influences from gospel, ("Toilet Tisha"), samba ("Humble Mumble") and drum and bass ("B.O.B."). This stylistic diversity was tied together by the pseudo-psychedelic production, emphasizing trippy synthesizers, spacey sound effects, techno-tinged percussion, and weird 70s-style psychedelic funk, updated in a more contemporary hip-hop context. The album\'s cover is an homage to Sly & the Family Stone\'s There\'s a Riot Goin\' On.\n\nIts limited edition artwork features a computer-generated image of a subset of the Mandelbrot set, a fractal.\n\nRobert Christgau of The Village Voice gave it an A rating and described Stankonia  as "comic and expansive P-Funk". Allmusic  gave the album 5 out of 5 stars and wrote "given the variety of moods, it helps that the album is broken up by brief, usually humorous interludes, which serve as a sort of reset button. It takes a few listens to pull everything together, but given the immense scope, it\'s striking how few weak tracks there are". Entertainment Weekly\'s Ken Tucker wrote that "Stankonia  reeks of artful ambition rendered with impeccable skill" and gave the album an A rating. Stankonia places as the 4th best ranked album of this century on Metacritic  with a score of 95, indicating universal acclaim.\n\nIn 2006, Time magazine named Stankonia as one of the 100 best albums of all time. In 2009, Pitchfork Media ranked Stankonia #13 on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s, and Rhapsody ranked it at #2 on its "100 Best Albums of the Decade" list. Rhapsody also ranked the album #6 on its "Hip-Hop’s Best Albums of the Decade" list. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade "best-of" list, saying, "With hummable hits (\'Ms. Jackson\') and out-there experiments (\'B.O.B.\'), the rap duo gave us all a visa to the funky if fictional land of Stankonia in 2000." <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/OutKast/Stankonia">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "To Pimp a Butterfly is the third studio album by American hip hop artist, Kendrick Lamar. The album was released on March 16, 2015, by Top Dawg Entertainment, Aftermath Entertainment, and distributed by Interscope Records. Upon its release, To Pimp a Butterfly received rave reviews from music critics. Lamar has described the album, which incorporates elements of funk, spoken word poetry and jazz, as \"honest, fearful and unapologetic.\" In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Kendrick indicated that the title was a play on Harper Lee's novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. He was quoted as saying, \"Just putting the word 'pimp' next to 'butterfly'… It's a trip. That's something that will be a phrase forever. It'll be taught in college courses — I truly believe that.\"\n\nOn Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of hundreds of reviews from music critics, the album has an average score of 96, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop gave it a perfect score, making it the third 10/10 he's given to a contemporary album. On music-reviewing website Rate Your Music, To Pimp A Butterfly has reached spot #13 on the list of the highest reviewed albums on the site. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Kendrick+Lamar/To+Pimp+a+Butterfly\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          summary:
            'Considered one of the best works yet released by Danny Brown, this album is extremely raw hip-hop in its new school form. Mixing up deep violent and thin psychotic flows, this work goes hard from the beginning to the very end. The first half of the album is focused on The Hybrid persona, with a lot of sarcastic humor, misogyny, and maniac rhymes. At a certain point, the album get really depressive and serious, reminding us that Danny has been under a lot of pressure and extreme situations in his life, and he knows how to rap about it. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/XXX+(Deluxe+Edition)">Read more on Last.fm</a>.',

At a certain point, the album get really depressive and serious, reminding us that Danny has been under a lot of pressure and extreme situations in his life, and he knows how to rap about it. Funny fact is that the first word he says in the album is "30", in the opening song "XXX". In the last song, "30", the last thing he says, closing the record, is "Triple X". <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/XXX+(Deluxe+Edition)">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Late Registration is the second studio album by American hip hop artist Kanye West, released on August 30, 2005, by Roc-A-Fella Records. Recording sessions for the album took place over the course of a year at Record Plant Studios, Chalice Recording Studios, and Grandmaster Recording Studios in Hollywood, and at Sony Music Studios in New York City. West collaborated with American record producer and composer Jon Brion to produce Late Registration, and the album features guest contributions from artists such as Jay-Z, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Nas, Brandy, and Adam Levine, among others.\n\nThe production is notably more lush and elaborate than West\'s previous album, The College Dropout. By collaborating with Jon Brion, West was able to utilize production styles and instruments not commonly associated with hip-hop music. More intricate sampling methods and the inclusion of string arrangements meant that the production featured on the album was unique to hip-hop music. West sought to deliver lyrics that allowed him to continue his style of storytelling during songs, and the album covers topics of social issues, such as poverty, drug trafficking, health care, and blood diamond trades.\n\nThe album produced five singles, including the international hits "Touch the Sky", "Heard \'Em Say" and "Gold Digger", the last of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 at number one. Music videos for all five singles were produced. Late Registration debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 860,000 copies in its first week. The album has sold over 3.1 million units in the United States and has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nUpon its release, Late Registration received rave reviews from music critics and earned West several accolades, including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 2006 Grammy Awards and an Album of the Year nomination. It appeared at the top of several publications year-end lists of top albums. Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2005, and included it at number 118 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2012. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Late+Registration">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'The College Dropout is the debut studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West. It was released on February 10, 2004, by Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records.\n\nA widespread critical success, The College Dropout was praised for West\'s production, humorous and emotional raps, and the music\'s balance of self-examination and mainstream sensibilities. It earned the rapper several accolades including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards. It has since been named by Time, Rolling Stone, and other publications as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn the years leading up to the album, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with Roc-A-Fella and recorded The College Dropout over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.\n\nThe album\'s production was primarily handled by West and developed his "chipmunk soul" production style, which made use of sped-up, pitch shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B records, in addition to West\'s own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs; it also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and Ludacris, among others. Diverging from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop, West\'s lyrics concern themes of family, self-consciousness, materialism, religion, racism, and higher education.\n\nThe College Dropout debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, selling 441,000 copies in its first week of sales. It was a massive commercial success, becoming West\'s best-selling album in the United States, with domestic sales of over 3.4 million copies by 2014. The album was promoted with singles such as "Through the Wire", "Jesus Walks", "All Falls Down", and "Slow Jamz", the latter two of which peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100.\n <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/The+College+Dropout">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'In Utero is the third and final studio album by the American alternative rock band Nirvana, released on September 21, 1993 by DGC Records. Following the success of the group\'s 1991 breakthrough album Nevermind, Nirvana sought to avoid that album\'s polished production and hired recording engineer Steve Albini to produce the record. The band recorded In Utero with Albini in two weeks in February 1993, capturing an abrasive and naturalistic sound for the record. While some of the songs had been written years prior, the lyrics largely dealt with frontman Kurt Cobain\'s reflections on his newfound fame and recent personal troubles, incorporating imagery of sickness and disease.\n\nSoon after recording was completed, controversy erupted as news reports stated that DGC did not like the band\'s sessions with Albini and refused to release the album, deeming it uncommercial. Nirvana denied the statements but were also not fully satisfied with the sound Albini captured. The band ultimately made some minor changes to the album\'s sound and hired producer Scott Litt to mix the singles "Heart-Shaped Box" and "All Apologies". Upon its release, In Utero debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from Nevermind. The record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold over four million copies in the United States.\n\nTo avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting In Utero; the company\'s head of marketing told Billboard before the album\'s release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar to that of Nevermind, and explained that the label would "set things up, duck, and get out of the way". The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Utero\'s singles commercially in the United States. DGC sent promo copies of the album\'s first single "Heart-Shaped Box" to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio. Despite the label\'s promotion, the band was convinced that In Utero would not be as successful as Nevermind. Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, "We\'re certain that we won\'t sell a quarter as much, and we\'re totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much."\n\nIn Utero was released on September 13, 1993 in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 in the United States; it was initially only available in vinyl record and cassette tape formats, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies. Although the album was issued on compact disc in the UK on September 14, a full domestic release did not occur until September 21. In Utero debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 180,000 copies in its first week of release. Meanwhile, retail chain stores Wal-Mart and Kmart refused to sell the album. According to The New York Times, Wal-Mart claimed it did not carry the album due to lack of consumer demand, while Kmart representatives explained that the album "didn\'t fit within our merchandise mix". In truth, both chains feared that customers would be offended by the artwork on the album\'s back cover. DGC issued a new version of the album with reworked packaging to the stores in March 1994. This version featured edited album artwork, and listed the name of "Rape Me" as "Waif Me". A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the packaging because as kids Cobain and Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain stores; as a result they "really want to make their music available to kids who don\'t have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".\n\nIn Utero received acclaim from critics. Time\'s Christopher John Farley stated in his review of the album, "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn\'t gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote, "In Utero is a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it\'s a triumph of the will." Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne (who gave the album a rating of B+) commented "Kurt Cobain hates it all", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, "The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke." NME gave the album an eight out of ten rating. However, reviewer John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, "As a document of a mind in flux — dithering, dissatisfied, unable to come to terms with sanity — Kurt should be proud of [the album]. As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn\'t quite there." Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album\'s more abrasive songs, "In Utero is beautiful far more often than it is ugly", and added, "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." Critics ranked In Utero as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics\' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.\n\nThat October, Nirvana embarked on its first American tour in two years to promote the album. A second single, a split release that featured "All Apologies" and "Rape Me", was issued in December in the United Kingdom. The band began a six-week European leg of the tour in February 1994, but it was cancelled after Cobain suffered a drug overdose in Rome on March 6. Cobain agreed to enter drug rehabilitation, but the singer went missing soon afterwards, and on April 8 he was found dead in his Seattle home as the result of suicide by a shotgun blast. The intended third single from In Utero, "Pennyroyal Tea", was cancelled in the wake of Cobain\'s death and the subsequent dissolution of Nirvana; limited promotional copies were released in Britain. Three days after Cobain\'s body was discovered, In Utero moved back up the Billboard charts, from number 72 to number 27.\n\nIn the ensuing years, In Utero has continued to perform commercially and gather critical praise. In a 2003 Guitar World article that commemorated the tenth anniversary of the album\'s release, Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross argued that In Utero was "a far better record [than Nevermind] and one that only 10 years later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or underappreciated, then In Utero is that lost pearl." That same year, Pitchfork Media placed In Utero at number 13 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s, and Rolling Stone ranked it at number 439 on its list "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2004 Blender ranked it at number 94 in its "100 Greatest American Albums of All Time" list, while in 2005, Spin placed it at number 51 on its "100 Greatest Albums 1985-2005" retrospective. In Utero has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over five million units, and has sold a total of four million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Bleach is the debut album by the American grunge band Nirvana. It was released on June 15, 1989 through the independent record label Sub Pop. Bleach originally sold a mere 30,000 copies, but following the enormous success of the band\'s second album, Nevermind (1991), fans discovered Nirvana\'s obscure debut. It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, making it one of only two albums released on Sub Pop to have received platinum certification.\n\nThe main sessions for Bleach took place at Reciprocal Recording Studios in Seattle, Washington, with local producer Jack Endino manning the board. Nirvana began recording with a five hour session on December 24, 1988. The band recorded again on December 29-31, and on January 14 and 24. Ultimately Endino billed the group for 30 hours of recording time. Three of the album\'s songs–"Floyd the Barber", "Paper Cuts", and the CD-only track "Downer"–were recorded during a previous session at Reciprocal Studios in 1988, featuring Dale Crover on drums. Despite attempts to re-record them with new drummer Chad Channing, the band ultimately decided to remix the versions recorded with Crover for the final version of Bleach. "Big Long Now" was omitted from the album because vocalist/guitarist Kurt Cobain felt "there was already enough slow heavy stuff on Bleach, and he "didn\'t want that song to go out", according to Endino. The album was edited and sequenced, but Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt ordered that the album be completely resequenced. The record was further delayed for several months until Sub Pop was able to secure sufficient funds to issue it.\n\nThe recording sessions were completed with a cost of $606. Jason Everman, a guitarist who was impressed by the band\'s demo with Dale Crover, supplied the money. He briefly joined Nirvana as a second guitarist. Everman is credited (removed on deluxe reissue) as a guitarist on the album sleeve, and is the other guitarist on the cover of the album, even though he did not perform on the record. Bassist Krist Novoselic explained, "We just wanted to make him feel at home in the band."The information above is incorrect in regards to the release date of "Bleach".\nThe singles, "Love Buzz/Big Cheese" were released in 1988 on the  Sub Pop Label; followed by the 1989 release of the album, "Bleach". According to the album sleeve it cost a whopping $606.17 to record, supplied by Jason Everman (who was fired after their first US tour). \nAfter becoming disenchanted with Sub Pop they then signed with DGC/Geffen in 1990 and in 1991 they released "Nevermind" (After the album\'s release members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given the album). Everyone knows how things went after this point, so there\'s no point in my continued writing.\n\nAccording to Cobain, the music on Bleach conformed with the grunge genre Sub Pop heavily endorsed. "There was this pressure from Sub Pop and the grunge scene to play \'rock music\'," Cobain said. "Strip it down and make it sound like Aerosmith." Cobain felt he had to fit the expectations of the grunge sound in order to build a fanbase, and so he purposefully suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits when crafting the record. Krist Novoselic noted in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their van while on tour that had an album by The Smithereens on one side and an album by the black metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well.\n\nCobain told Spin in 1993 that with Bleach "I didn\'t give a flying fuck what the lyrics were about," and claimed that eighty percent of the lyrics were written the night before recording. Cobain often was still working on them on the drive to the recording studio. He explained, "It was like I\'m pissed off. Don\'t know what about. Let\'s just scream negative lyrics, and as long as they\'re not sexist and don\'t get too embarrassing it\'ll be okay. I don\'t hold any of those lyrics dear to me." Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad noted that nevertheless many of the songs on the album were reflective of Cobain and various incidents in his life. "Mr. Moustache" was inspired by Cobain\'s dislike of macho behavior, while "School" was a critique of the Seattle music scene, particularly Sub Pop.\n\nSub Pop pressed the first 1,000 copies on white vinyl, the next 2,000 on black, and all subsequent pressings were on red and blue. The first 3,000 copies of the record came with a poster, featuring Jason Everman. The vinyl pressings omitted "Big Cheese" or "Downer". In the United Kingdom, the record was released on Tupelo Records in June 1989. The first 300 Tupelo copies were pressed on white vinyl; the next 2,000 copies were on dark green. The rest of the Tupelo copies were on black vinyl. The Tupelo copies did contain "Love Buzz", but "Big Cheese" was listed on the label and sleeve instead. They also did not contain "Downer". In Australia, Bleach was released on Waterfront Records and later re-issued on various colored covers and colored vinyl prior to 1992. Sub Pop released a remastered version of the album on CD and cassette in April 1992.\n\nFor the 20th anniversary of the album, Sub Pop released a deluxe reissue of Bleach featuring a March 2009 remastering from the original tapes by George Marino and a live recording of a 1990 show at Portland, Oregon\'s Pine Street Theatre.\n\nThe album\'s working title was Too Many Humans. It was renamed Bleach after Cobain found an AIDS prevention poster while Nirvana was driving through San Francisco. The poster advised heroin addicts to bleach their needles before use, featuring the slogan "Bleach Your Works." <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Bleach">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Loveless is the second studio album by Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine, released on 4 November 1991 by Creation Records. The album was recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled percussion and feedback. The group cycled through nineteen studios and a larger number of engineers during the album\'s two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £250,000.\n\nWhile Loveless did not achieve great commercial success upon its release, it received enthusiastic reviews from critics, who praised its sonic innovations and Shields\'s "virtual reinvention of the guitar." Following the record\'s release, My Bloody Valentine were removed from their record label Creation Records due to the difficulty and expense of working with Shields, a factor that was alleged to have contributed to the bankruptcy of the label. In the subsequent years, the group struggled to record a follow-up album and would eventually break up in 1997. Loveless would be their last full-length release for over two decades.\n\nSince its release, Loveless has been widely proclaimed by critics as among the best albums of the 1990s, as a landmark work of the shoegazing genre, and as a significant influence on various subsequent artists. The album was reissued as a two-CD set on Sony in May 2012, containing remastered editions of the original digital tape and a previously unreleased ½-inch analogue tape. The reissues placed in several international charts and in July 2013, Loveless was certified Silver in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/Loveless">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            '"Jane Doe" is the fourth full-length studio album by American metalcore band Converge. The album is often considered Converge\'s masterpiece, and has been frequently described as one of the greatest metal/hardcore albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone, Decibel, and NPR Music. According to vocalist/lyricist Jacob Bannon, "the album\'s lyrical themes were born out of a dissolving relationship and the emotional fallout from that experience"\n\nIn January 2007, Decibel magazine certified the album number 35 in the "Decibel Hall of Fame", and later named it the best album of the \'00s. J. Bennett writes that "Jane Doe was both a semi-melodic milestone ("Hell to Pay", "Thaw", the title track) and a discordant landmark (everything else), far and away the most crucial metallic hardcore record since Cave In unleashed Until Your Heart Stops three years earlier", while Kerrang! stated "With feral blasting, extreme technicality, intense emotion and an overwhelmingly bleak tone... [Jane Doe is an] awe-inspiring listening experience..." On June 11, 2010, Sputnikmusic deemed Jane Doe the best album of the decade, earning the #1 spot on its top 100 albums of the decade list. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Converge/Jane+Doe">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Led Zeppelin is the debut album of English rock  band Led Zeppelin. It was recorded in October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London and released on Atlantic Records on 12 January 1969. The album featured integral contributions from each of the group\'s four musicians and established Led Zeppelin\'s fusion of blues and rock. Led Zeppelin also created a large and devoted following for the band, with their unique heavy metal sound endearing them to a section of the counterculture on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nAlthough the album initially received negative reviews, it was commercially very successful and has now come to be regarded in a much more positive light by critics. In 2003, the album was ranked number 29 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nIn August 1968, the English rock band The Yardbirds had completely disbanded. Guitarist Jimmy Page, The Yardbirds\' sole remaining member, was left with rights to the group’s name and contractual obligations for a series of concerts in Scandinavia. For his new band, Page recruited bassist John Paul Jones, vocalist Robert Plant and drummer John Bonham. During September 1968, the group toured Scandinavia as The New Yardbirds, performing some old Yardbirds material as well as new songs such as "Communication Breakdown", "I Can\'t Quit You Baby", "You Shook Me", "Babe I\'m Gonna Leave You" and "How Many More Times". The month after they returned to England, October 1968, Page changed the band\'s name to Led Zeppelin, and the group entered Olympic Studios in London to record their debut album.\n\nIn a 1990 interview, Page said that the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knows this because of the amount charged on the studio bill. One of the primary reasons for the short recording time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on Led Zeppelin\'s tour of Scandinavia in September 1968.  As Page explained, "the band had begun developing the arrangements on the Scandinavian tour and I knew what sound I was looking for. It just came together incredibly quickly."\n\nIn addition, since the band had not yet signed their deal with Atlantic Records, Page and Led Zeppelin\'s manager Peter Grant paid for the sessions entirely themselves, meaning there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. In another interview, Page revealed that the self-funding was to ensure artistic freedom, "I wanted artistic control in a vice grip, because I knew exactly what I wanted to do with these fellows. In fact, I financed and completely recorded the first album before going to Atlantic. ... It wasn\'t your typical story where you get an advance to make an album—we arrived at Atlantic with tapes in hand ... Atlantic\'s reaction was very positive—I mean they signed us, didn\'t they?"\n\nThe group recorded their songs reportedly for £1,782. Led Zeppelin expert Dave Lewis noted that "with the possible exception of the 12 hours that the Beatles took to record their first album at Abbey Road, rarely has studio time been used so economically. Led Zeppelin\'s debut album went on to gross more than £3.5 million, just short of 2,000 times more than they invested!"\n\nFor the recordings, Page played a psychedelically painted Fender Telecaster, a gift from Jeff Beck after Page recommended his boyhood friend to the Yardbirds in 1965 as potential replacement for Eric Clapton on lead guitar. This was a different guitar from those he favoured for later albums (most notably a Gibson Les Paul). Page played the Telecaster through a Supro amplifier. He also used a Gibson J-200, borrowed from Big Jim Sullivan, for the album\'s acoustic tracks.\n\nLed Zeppelin was produced by Jimmy Page and engineered by Glyn Johns, who had previously worked with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and The Who. According to Page, "The first album is a live album, it really is, and it\'s done intentionally in that way. It\'s got overdubs on it, but the original tracks are live."\n\nPage reportedly used natural room ambience to enhance the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. Up until the late 1960s, most music producers placed microphones directly in front of the amplifiers and drums. For Led Zeppelin Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as twenty feet) and then recording the balance between the two. By adopting this "distance equals depth" technique, Page became one of the first producers to record a band\'s "ambient sound"—the distance of a note\'s time-lag from one end of the room to the other.\n\nAnother notable feature of the album was the "leakage" on the recordings of Robert Plant\'s vocals. In a 1998 Guitar World interview, Page stated that "Robert\'s voice was extremely powerful and, as a result, would get on some of the other tracks. But oddly, the leakage sounds intentional."On the track "You Shook Me", Page used the "backward echo" technique. It involves hearing the echo before the main sound (instead of after it), and is achieved by turning the tape over and employing the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.\n\nThe album was one of the first albums to be released in stereo-only form; at the time the practice of releasing both mono and stereo versions was the norm.\n\nLed Zeppelin\'s front cover, which was chosen by Page, features a black-and-white image of the burning Hindenburg airship. The image refers to the origin of the band\'s name itself: when Page, Jeff Beck and The Who\'s Keith Moon and John Entwistle were discussing the idea of forming a group, Moon joked, "It would probably go over like a lead balloon", and Entwistle allegedly replied, "...a Lead Zeppelin!"\n\nThe album\'s back cover features a photograph of the band taken by former-Yardbird Chris Dreja. The entire design of the album\'s sleeve was coordinated by George Hardie, with whom the band would continue to collaborate for future sleeves.\n\nHardie recalled that he originally offered the band a design based on an old club sign in San Francisco—a multi-sequential image of a phallic zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was retained as the logo for the back cover of Led Zeppelin\'s first two albums and a number of early press advertisements. During the first few weeks of release in the UK, the sleeve featured the band\'s name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When this was switched to the now-common orange print later in the year, the turquoise-printed sleeve became a collector\'s item.\n\nThe album cover received widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed as "The Nobs" as the result of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative of the creator of the Zeppelin aircraft). von Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the Hindenburg crashing in flames, threatened to have the show pulled off the air. In 2001, Greg Kot wrote in Rolling Stone that "The cover of Led Zeppelin. . . shows the Hindenburg airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames. The image did a pretty good job of encapsulating the music inside: sex, catastrophe and things blowing up."\n\nThe conceptual originality of the album was displayed on tracks such as "Good Times Bad Times", "Dazed and Confused" and "Communication Breakdown", which had a distinctively heavy sound to the ears of young rock fans in the late-1960s. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate steel-string acoustic guitar by Page on "Black Mountain Side", and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on their adaptation of "Babe I\'m Gonna Leave You".\n\n"Dazed and Confused" is arguably the album\'s centerpiece: a foreboding arrangement featuring a descending bass line from Jones, heavy drumming from Bonham and some powerful guitar riffs and soloing from Page. It also showcased Page playing guitar with a violin bow (an idea suggested by David McCallum Sr., whom Page had met while doing studio session work). The bowed guitar in the middle section of the song brought psychedelic rock to experimental new heights, especially in extended stage versions, building on Page\'s earlier renderings of the song during the latter days of The Yardbirds. "Dazed and Confused" would become Led Zeppelin\'s signature performance piece for years to come. The bowed guitar technique is also used on "How Many More Times", a song which features a "Bolero" riff and an improvised shift in cadence.\n\nMany of Led Zeppelin\'s earliest songs were based on blues standards, and the album also included three songs composed by others: "You Shook Me" and "I Can\'t Quit You Baby", both by blues artist Willie Dixon; and "Babe I\'m Gonna Leave You". Regarding the last of these, at the time guitarist Jimmy Page mistakenly believed he was adapting a traditional folk song he had heard on a Joan Baez record, but this was corrected on subsequent rereleases after it was revealed that the song was composed by Anne Bredon in the 1950s. Dixon, on the other hand, received proper credit as the composer of his two songs on this album (although "You Shook Me" would later be additionally credited to J. B. Lenoir) but would go on to settle out of court with Led Zeppelin over partial use of other material of his on Plant\'s lyrics to "Whole Lotta Love". On "You Shook Me", Plant vocally mimics Page\'s guitar effects—a metallicised version of the "call and response" blues technique.\n\nJeff Beck had previously recorded "You Shook Me" for his album, Truth, and accused Page of stealing his idea. With John Paul Jones and drummer Keith Moon of The Who, Page had played on (and says he arranged) "Beck\'s Bolero", an instrumental on Truth that would be grooved into the mix of the Led Zeppelin jam "How Many More Times". These cross-pollinations led to a rift between Beck and Page, who had played in the Yardbirds together and been friends since childhood. In fact, it was Page who first suggested Beck for the Yardbirds\' guitarist position when he was contacted by the band after Eric Clapton\'s departure.\n\nIn an interview he gave in 1975, Page offered his own perspective on the album\'s music:\n\n    For material, we obviously went right down to our blues roots. I still had plenty of Yardbirds riffs left over. By the time Jeff Beck did go, it was up to me to come up with a lot of new stuff. It was this thing where Eric Clapton set a heavy precedent in the Yardbirds which Beck had to follow and then it was even harder for me, in a way, because the second lead guitarist had suddenly become the first. And I was under pressure to come up with my own riffs. On the first LP I was still heavily influenced by the earlier days. I think it tells a bit, too... It was obvious that somebody had to take the lead, otherwise we\'d have all sat around jamming for six months. But after that, on the second LP, you can really hear the group identity coming together.\n\nPlant is credited on the album with "occasional bass". In an interview he gave to Rolling Stone magazine in 2005, Plant made reference to this:\n\n    In truth, I was an occasional bass player. It says so on Zeppelin I, next to my name: vocals, harmonica and occasional bass. Very occasionally -- once, I think, since 1968. How in God\'s name that ended up on the cover is so funny. I\'m sure Jonesy John Paul Jones didn\'t like it *laughs*. But I suppose every time he fucked up he could say it was me.\n\nThe album was advertised in selected music papers under the slogan "Led Zeppelin — the only way to fly".  It initially received poor reviews. In a stinging assessment, Rolling Stone magazine asserted that the band offered "little that its twin, the Jeff Beck Group, didn\'t say as well or better three months ago ... It would seem that if they are to fil the void created by the demise of Cream, they will have to find a producer, editor and some material worthy of their collective talents."  It also called Plant "as foppish as Rod Stewart, but nowhere near so exciting". John Paul Jones later recalled:\n\n    We had appalling press at the time. Nobody seemed to want to know us for one reason or another. We got to America and read the Rolling Stone review of the very first album, which was going on about us as another hyped British band. We couldn\'t belive it. In our naivety we thought we\'d done a good album and were doing all right, and then this venom comes flying out. We couldn\'t understand why or what we\'d done to them. After that we were very wary of the press, which became a chicken-and-egg situation. We avodied them and so they avoided us. It was only because we did a lot of show that our reputation got around as a good live band.\n\nAs was noted by rock journalist Cameron Crowe years later: "It was a time of "super-groups," of furiously hyped bands who could barely cut it, and Led Zeppelin initially found themselves fighting upstream to prove their authenticity."\n\nHowever, press reaction to the album was not entirely negative. In Britain the album received a glowing review in the Melody Maker. Chris Welch wrote, in a review titled "Jimmy Page triumphs — Led Zeppelin is a gas!": "their material does not rely on obvious blues riffs, although when they do play them, they avoid the emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues bands".\n\nThe album was very commercially successful. It was initially released in America on 17 January 1969 to capitalise on the band\'s first U.S. concert tour. Before that, Atlantic Records had distributed a few hundred advance white label copies to key radio stations and reviewers. A positive reaction to its contents, coupled with a good reaction to the band\'s opening concerts, resulted in the album generating 50,000 advance orders. Within two months of its release the album had reached Billboard\'s Top 10. It stayed on the Billboard chart for 73 weeks and held a 79-week run on the British charts. By 1975 it had grossed $7,000,000.\n\nThe success and influence of the album is today widely acknowledged, even amongst those critics who were initially skeptical. In 2006, for example, Rolling Stone stated that\n\n    The album was pretty much unlike anything else. The arrangements were more sculpted than those of Cream or Jimi Hendrix, and the musicianship wasn\'t cumbersome like Iron Butterfly\'s or bombastic like Vanilla Fudge\'s. The closest comparisons might be to MC5 or the Stooges—both from Michigan—yet neither had the polish or prowess of Led Zeppelin, nor did Led Zeppelin have the political, social or die-hard sensibility of those landmark bands. What they did have, though, was the potential for a mass audience.\n\nAccording to Lewis:\n\n    Time has done nothing to diminish the quality of one of the finest debut albums ever recorded. There\'s an urgency and enthusiasm about their performance that retains timeless charm. The nine cuts offer a tour de force of powerful yet often subtle dynamics ... And let\'s not forget the fact that with this album, Page virtually invents the guitar riff as a key songwriting component.\n\nIn 2003, VH1 named Led Zeppelin the 44th greatest album of all time, while Rolling Stone ranked it 29th on the magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It is widely regarded as marking a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal.\n\nPublication   Country    Accolade     Year      Rank\n\nThe Times United Kingdom "The 100 Best Albums of All Time" 1993 41\nRolling Stone United States The Rolling Stone 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 2003 29\nGrammy Awards \tUnited States Grammy Hall of Fame Award 2004\t*\nQ United Kingdom "The Music That Changed the World" 2004 7\nRobert Dimery United States 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die 2006 *\nClassic Rock United Kingdom\t"100 Greatest British Rock Album Ever"\t2006 81\nUncut United Kingdom 100 Greatest Debut Albums 2006 7\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame United States The Definitive 200 2007 165\nQ United Kingdom 21 Albums That Changed Music 2007 6\n\n\n"How Many More Times" was listed as 3:30 on the record sleeve deliberately by Jimmy Page in order to trick radio stations into playing the song.citation needed\n\nRobert Plant participated in songwriting but wasn\'t given credit because of unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association with CBS Records.\n\nSome cassette versions of the album reversed the order of the sides.

            "Led Zeppelin II is the second studio album by English rock band Led Zeppelin, released 22 October 1969 on Atlantic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at several locations in the United Kingdom and North America from January to August 1969. Production was entirely credited to lead guitarist and songwriter Jimmy Page, while it also served as Led Zeppelin's first album to utilise the recording techniques of engineer Eddie Kramer. The album furthered the lyrical themes established on their debut album, Led Zeppelin (1969). This progress helped create a work that became more widely acclaimed and influential than its predecessor. With elements of blues and folk music, it also exhibits the band's evolving musical style of blues-derived material and their guitar and riff-based sound.\nUpon release, Led Zeppelin II earned a considerable amount of sales and was Led Zeppelin's first album to reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States. In 1970, art director David Juniper was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Recording Package for Led Zeppelin II. On 15 November 1999, it was certified 12x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales in excess of 12 million copies. Following its initial reception, it has been recognized by writers and music critics as one of the greatest and most influential rock albums recorded. Led Zeppelin II has also been cited by critics as a blueprint for heavy metal bands that followed it. In 2003, the album was ranked number 75 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Led+Zeppelin/Led+Zeppelin+II\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'A Night at the Opera is a 1975 album by English rock band Queen. It was produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, and reportedly was, at the time of its release, the most expensive album ever made. It was originally released by EMI in the UK where it topped the charts for nine weeks, a record at the time, and Elektra Records in the United States where the album peaked at #4 and has been certified Triple Platinum (three million copies sold).\nThe album takes its name from the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band watched one night at the studio complex when recording. The 1976 follow-up album, A Day at the Races, was also named after a Marx brothers film.\n\nAt the time the most expensive album ever recorded, Brian May has asserted in subsequent years that the band would have disbanded had it not been successful. Upon release, A Night at the Opera was a commercial and critical success, debuting at #1 in the UK charts and remaining there for nine weeks. In the US, it debuted at #4, the band\'s strongest showing at that time. Reviews were generally positive. Rolling Stone wrote: "What sets them apart is their selection of unlikely effects: acoustic piano, harp, acapella vocals, no synthesizers. Coupled with good songs. Queen\'s obviously the strongest contender in its field." Melody Maker called the album a "must-have," encouraging listeners to "turn it up loud and enjoy," while the Winnipeg Free Press wrote: "The group\'s potential is practically limitless, indicating that Queen is destined to finally take its place among the small handful of truly major acts working in rock today." Robert Christgau, however, was less enthusiastic, giving the album a "B-" rating. Later reviews in notable publications such as Allmusic, Mojo and Q Magazine, have seen the album receive five-star ratings. Allmusic wrote: "It\'s prog rock with a sense of humor as well as dynamics, and Queen never bettered their approach anywhere else." Mojo called the album "An imperial extravaganza, a cornucopia; a band of hungrily competitive individualists on a big roll of friendship and delight." Q were similarly receptive, writing: "It\'s a record to which all four contributed fine songs, and one of extremes -- among the crashing rock and proggy wigouts were love songs, acoustic whimsy, a trad-jazz pastiche and a brace of vaudeville show tunes." Uncut awarded the album only 3/5 stars, but offered a mostly positive review, commending "the extent of the band\'s barmy diversity."\n\nSince its release, A Night at the Opera has frequently been cited as one of Queen\'s finest works. In particular, Bohemian Rhapsody, the album\'s centerpiece, received acclaim and is still considered among the greatest songs ever recorded. The British public voted it the 13th greatest album of all time in a 2004 Channel 4 poll, and the 9th greatest number one album of all time in a 2006 BBC poll. The album has also ranked highly in international polls and has frequently appeared in "greatest albums" lists reflecting the opinions of critics.\n\nA Night at the Opera appears alongside other Queen albums Queen II and Sheer Heart Attack in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nThe album was first time re-released in the US on Hollywood Records on 3 September 1991 with two bonus remixes, as part of a complete re-release of all Queen albums.\n\nOn 30 April 2002 the album was again re-released on DVD-Audio with a 5.1-channel mix in Dolby Digital and DTS surround sound.\n\nOn 21 November 2005 it was once more re-released to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album and its first single, "Bohemian Rhapsody". This release is accompanied by a DVD-Video disc with the same track listing featuring the original videos, old and new concert footage (including "\'39" from the Queen + Paul Rodgers tour and Brian May on the roof of Buckingham Palace playing "God Save the Queen") and audio commentary by all four bandmembers. It was on this commentary (and on In the Studio with Redbeard, which devoted an episode to A Night at the Opera) that May stated that had the album not been a success, Queen certainly would have disbanded. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Queen/A+Night+at+the+Opera">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Imagine is John Lennon\'s second solo album and is considered the most popular of his solo works. Recorded and released in 1971, the album tended toward songs that were gentler, more commercial and less avant-garde than the ones he released on his more critically acclaimed previous album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The difference, he said, was that Imagine was "chocolate-coated for public consumption", in reference to the string sections prevalent throughout the album. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/Imagine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.',

            'Imagine is John Lennon\'s second solo album and is considered the most popular of his solo works. Recorded and released in 1971, the album tended toward songs that were gentler, more commercial and less avant-garde than the ones he released on his more critically acclaimed previous album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The difference, he said, was that Imagine was "chocolate-coated for public consumption", in reference to the string sections prevalent throughout the album.\n\nBasic tracks for the album were recorded in his home studio (Ascot Sound Studios in Tittenhurst Park) with strings overdubs added at the Record Plant in New York City. As on his last album, Phil Spector joined Lennon and Yoko Ono as co-producer on Imagine. Extensive footage of the sessions, showing the evolution of some of the songs, was compiled on a video documentary entitled Gimme Some Truth: The Making of John Lennon\'s Imagine.\n\nThe title track "Imagine" became Lennon\'s signature tune and was written as a plea for world peace. "Jealous Guy" has also had enduring popularity and was originally composed as "Child of Nature" during the songwriting sessions in India in 1968 that led to The Beatles\' double-album The Beatles. "Oh My Love" and the song "How?" were influenced by his experience with primal therapy: "How?" contains the questions he was facing while going through the changes produced in him during the ongoing process of primal therapy, while "Oh My Love" was written to communicate the joy and growth Lennon was experiencing as a result of the therapy.\n\nLennon also indulged his love of rock and roll with "Crippled Inside" and "It\'s So Hard." "Gimme Some Truth", originally heard in the Let It Be sessions, appears on the album with a new bridge. The politically-themed "I Don\'t Wanna Be a Soldier" closes the first half of Imagine in a cacophonous manner.\n\nGeorge Harrison guested on a few of Imagine\'s tracks, most infamously "How Do You Sleep?", Lennon\'s response to what he considered veiled remarks about him on Paul McCartney\'s then-current album Ram. Although Lennon softened his stance in the mid-70s and claimed he wrote the song about himself, he revealed in 1980, "I used my resentment against Paul... to create a song... not a terrible vicious horrible vendetta... I used my resentment and withdrawing from Paul and The Beatles, and the relationship with Paul, to write \'How Do You Sleep\'. I don\'t really go \'round with those thoughts in my head all the time".\n\nEarly editions of the Imagine LP included a postcard featuring a photo of Lennon holding a pig in mockery of McCartney\'s similar pose with a sheep of the cover of Ram. At the end of the album is "Oh Yoko!", a ode to his wife complete with a Bob Dylan-style harmonica solo.\n\nUpon release in September and October 1971, Imagine was warmly regarded by critics and promptly went to #1 worldwide and became an enduring seller, with the title track reaching #3 in the U.S. and #1 in the UK following Lennon\'s death. In 2000, Yoko Ono supervised the remixing of Imagine for its remastered reissue.\n\nIn 2003, Imagine was placed at #76 in Rolling Stone\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and reissued by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab on gold CD and on 180 gram half-speed mastered vinyl. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/John+Lennon/Imagine">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "Pornography is the fourth studio album by English rock band The Cure, released on 4 May 1982 by Fiction Records. Preceded by the non-album single \"Charlotte Sometimes\", it was the band's first album with new producer Phil Thornalley, and was recorded at RAK Studios from January to April 1982. The sessions saw the band on the brink of collapse, with heavy drug use, band infighting, and frontman Robert Smith's depression fueling the album's musical and lyrical content. Pornography represents the conclusion of The Cure's early dark, gloomy musical phase, which began with their second album Seventeen Seconds (1980).\n\nFollowing its release, bassist Simon Gallup left the band, and The Cure switched to a much brighter and more radio-friendly new wave sound. Although it was poorly received by critics at the time of release, Pornography is The Cure's most popular album to date, reaching number eight on the UK Albums Chart. It has since gone on to gain acclaim from critics, and is now considered an important milestone in the development of the style of music known as gothic rock. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/Pornography\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Master of Puppets is the third studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica. The album was recorded in 1985 and released by Elektra Records on March 3, 1986 in North America.\n\nNow widely considered a classic of thrash metal, the album proved to be a modest commercial success upon its release by reaching #29 on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it the very first thrash metal album to crack the Top 40. With the band\'s rising popularity from the release of Metallica, awareness of the album has increased, and according to the RIAA, it has sold over six million copies in the U.S. alone. It was the last album the band recorded with bass player Cliff Burton, who died in a tour bus crash six months after it was released.\n\nHistorical significance\n\nThe band\'s line-up during the album\'s recording was James Hetfield on vocals and rhythm guitar, Lars Ulrich on drums, Kirk Hammett on lead guitar, and Cliff Burton on bass. The album is remembered in part due to the death of Burton shortly after the release of the album in a bus accident while supporting the album on tour.\n\nWhen it was released, Master of Puppets provided many metal fans with an alternative image to the commercially popular glam metal bands, such as Poison, Bon Jovi,Mötley Crüe, and Ratt. The album has frequently been tagged by critics as "one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all time."\n\nAs an early parody of the PMRC\'s "explicit lyrics" warning labels, many prints of Metallica\'s 1986 release of Master of Puppets sported a sticker on the front in the shape of a stop-sign saying:\n\n    "The only track you probably won\'t want to play is "Damage, Inc." due to the multiple use of the infamous "F" word. otherwise, there aren\'t any "Shits," "Fucks," "Pisses," "Sucks," "Cunts," "Motherfuckers," or "Cocksuckers" anywhere on this record"\n\nTo celebrate the 20th anniversary of its release, Metallica played the album in its entirety on their Escape from the Studio \'06 tour, for the first time ever at the Rock am Ring festival on June 3, 2006. These concerts included the first-ever complete performances of the instrumental "Orion" (though portions of the song\'s lengthy middle section had been performed at various times as part of instrumental medleys and bass solos since the early 1990s).\n\nThe title track was ranked Number 51 in the "The Greatest Guitar Solos" from Guitar World. In 2006, the album was voted the fourth "greatest guitar album of all time" in Guitar World. And the April 5, edition of Kerrang! was dedicated to it, providing readers with the cover album "Master of Puppets: Remastered". In March 2007, the guitar magazine Total Guitar ranked the 100 greatest riffs of all time, and the main riff in the album\'s title track was ranked number one.\n\nFormer Metallica guitarist Dave Mustaine has long claimed to have written the riff for "Leper Messiah". Metallica has denied it.\n\nIn 1999, Master of Puppets was re-released with Ride the Lightning in a remastered audiophile Gold CD edition mixed by renowned engineer Steve Hoffman.\n\nReception\n\nUpon its release, Master of Puppets was immediately commercially successful, selling over half a million copies at its time of release without any major video/radio airplay, making it the band\'s first record to be certified Gold by the RIAA.\n\nAccording to Allmusic\'s Steve Huey, Master of Puppets "was the band\'s greatest achievement." "Some critics have called Master of Puppets the best heavy metal album ever recorded", Huey noted. Master of Puppets has featured on several "greatest albums of all time" lists. The album is present in a list dubbed "The All-TIME 100 Albums" and published by TIME magazine in November 2006. In TIME critic Josh Tyrangiel\'s opinion, "Metallica didn\'t bother with hooks or pop discipline" in writing Master of Puppets. Metal Rules rated the album as being number one in a list of the "Top 100 Heavy Metal Albums" published in September 2003, whereas IGN also rated the album as being at first position in a list of the "Top 25 Metal Albums" issued in January 2007. It is included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and Q magazine counted it among the 50 heaviest albums of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 167 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Master+of+Puppets">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the United States alone Ride The Lightning has sold over 5 million copies.\n\nRide the Lightning is often hailed by fans as a classic of the thrash metal genre and a vital bridge between the band\'s albums Kill \'Em All and Master of Puppets, pushing the thrash metal of the debut into progressive territory more fully-realized on "Master of Puppets" and "...And Justice for All."\n\nRide the Lightning retains the speed of Kill \'Em All on songs like "Trapped Under Ice" and "Fight Fire with Fire", but also contains the first of Metallica\'s longer, more intricate tracks, such as "Fade to Black" and the nearly 9-minute closing instrumental "The Call of Ktulu". "Ride the Lightning" is the last Metallica album to credit Dave Mustaine.\n\nRide the Lightning was listed at #3 on a list compiled by metal-rules.com of the Top 100 Metal Albums of All Time and #5 by IGN Music on the Top 25 Metal Albums. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/Ride+the+Lightning">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            '...And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica. Elektra Records released the album on August 25, 1988. This is the first Metallica studio album to feature bassist Jason Newsted, since it is the first after the tragic death of the group\'s former bassist Cliff Burton.\n\nThe album\'s dark subject material, featuring references to nuclear apocalypse, injustice in the law system, limited freedom, war, insanity and hate, is accompanied by the most complex song structures to this date in Metallica\'s discography. The album is also noted for its near lack of bass guitar and dry production and therefore has been called a "slightly flawed masterpiece and the pinnacle of Metallica\'s progressive years" by allmusic.com\'s reviewer.\n\nThe front cover depicts the statue of Lady Justice cracked and bound by ropes, with both of her scales filled with dollars and both of her breasts exposed. The words "…And Justice for All" are written in graffiti to the right. The cover is made by Stephen Gorman after a concept by James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich.\n\nThe album has sold over 8 million copies in the US alone according to the RIAA and was the best selling Metallica record upon its release. Metallica released four singles from …And Justice for All, "Eye of the Beholder", "Harvester of Sorrow", "…And Justice for All" and "One".\n\nProduction \n\nThe production of the album is noted for its unusual, and at times "one-dimensional", post-production mix. The quality of the album\'s sound has been described as "cold", "thin" and "flat", due in part to the way the instruments were recorded. The bass drums don\'t "thud" so much as "click", while the guitars "buzz thinly". And, in one of the more famous of Hetfield and Ulrich\'s controversies with bassist Jason Newsted, the album\'s production almost completely lacks identifiable bass in most songs. This has been attributed to various reasons, such as Newsted\'s doubling of Hetfield\'s guitar parts, his absence from the mixing sessions (where he might have asserted his opinion) and the lingering issue of his "newness" within the band following the tragic death of Cliff Burton in September 1986. As said by the band in their magazine SO WHAT!, they wish that they could re-mix the entire album because the drums and guitar overpower the bass completely. The album was released on two LPs at the usual single-LP price, since the band thought that putting the album on a single record would have diminished its fidelity.\n\nLyrical themes\n\nThe lyrics on …And Justice for All discuss politics and social issues; however, lyricist James Hetfield is more direct than ever before in his views. At the same time, and despite Hetfield\'s aggressive singing style, the lyrics refrain from overt confrontation or ringing calls for revolutionary change. Instead, as drummer Lars Ulrich explained it, the ideas expressed in the lyrics merely represented "interests" of the band, and were meant largely to be "documentary" in nature. Important themes in the songs include destruction of Earth in "Blackened", injustice in the law system in "…And Justice for All", limited freedom in "Eye of the Beholder", war and locked-in syndrome in "One", cheating and lying in "The Shortest Straw", infanticide in "Harvester of Sorrow", insanity in "The Frayed Ends of Sanity", the death of Cliff Burton in "To Live Is to Die" and hatred of authority in "Dyers Eve".\n\nConnections with other Metallica albums\n\nThe album continues the trends set by the previous albums Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets by having a fast paced, striking song with a melodic, slow intro as the first track, the title track as the second track, a slower, heavier track as the third track, a heavy metal ballad as the fourth track, a fast-paced track as the fifth track, a track slower than the fifth track as the sixth track, and an instrumental or mostly instrumental track as well as a fast, heavy song as the final tracks. However, in the case of this album, a song is added onto the structure ("The Frayed Ends of Sanity").\n\n\nIt has been noted by several people that the complexity of the songs on …And Justice for All was a direct reason for the more simple structures on Metallica\'s next album, The Black Album. Allmusic.com\'s reviewer Steve Huey also pointed out that …And Justice for All\'s unusual production may have led Metallica to a more "professional" producer, Bob Rock. It can be said that …And Justice for All marked the end of Metallica\'s thrash metal period, at least until their newest album, Death Magnetic.\n\nCritical response\n\n...And Justice for All was Metallica\'s breakthrough album and reached #6 in the Billboard charts. Though it would soon be over-shadowed commercially by the band\'s following album (1991\'s Metallica), this album nevertheless confirmed Metallica\'s large-scale arena status.\n\nThe album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance in 1989, but with much controversy, it lost to Jethro Tull\'s Crest of a Knave. In 2007, the win was named one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly.\n\nIn 1990, "One" received the first-ever Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, as well as being Metallica\'s first Grammy Award.\n\nThe guitar solo of "One" was ranked #7 in Guitar World\'s compilation of the 100 Greatest Guitar Solos of all time.\n\nThe album was ranked at number nine in IGN\'s Top 25 Metal Albums.\n\nMetallica released their first music video for "One", after years of resisting pressure to release videos for their tracks. The video incited controversy among their fans, who had valued the band\'s apparent opposition to MTV and other forms of mainstream commercial metal. "One" entered the Top 40 on March 25, 1989 at #35.\n\nLive performances\n\nHammett noted the length of the songs being problematic for fans and the band. "Touring behind it, we realized that the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long," he said. "One day after we played \'Justice\' and got off the stage one of us said, \'we\'re never fucking playing that song again.\'"\n\nIn spite of this, the song "One" quickly gained a permanent fixture in the band\'s live playlist since the release of the album. The only other song from …And Justice For All that has come close to this is "Harvester of Sorrow," a song that was played live heavily after the album\'s release but has only begun to be played again recently.\n\n16 years after "Dyers Eve" was recorded, on March 5, 2004, the band performed the song in its entirety for the first time ever on the Madly in Anger with the World Tour, at the Great Western Forum in Los Angeles, California.\n\nOn June 28, 2007, Metallica played the title track for the first time since October 1989, in Lisbon on the first show of their Sick of the Studio \'07 tour and made it a set-fixture for the remainder of that routing. In 2008, "...And Justice for All" was played again during their 2008 Tour.\n\nTo date, "The Frayed Ends of Sanity" and "To Live Is to Die" remain the only songs from the album that have never been performed live in their entirety. Instead, the band played segments of them during solos or impromptu jams.\n\nAlong with "Dyers Eve", "To Live Is to Die" is one of the most demanded songs to be played live of Metallica\'s catalogue, it is unknown if Metallica will play this song live, due to the song being made up of deceased bassist Cliff Burton\'s final riff tapes. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Metallica/...and+Justice+for+All">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A remixed and remastered version, featuring several bonus tracks, was released in 2004.\n\nSingles featured on the album include "Holy Wars...The Punishment Due", and "Hangar 18", both of which were made into music videos.\n\nThis was the first Megadeth album to feature Marty Friedman and Nick Menza.\n\nProduction\n\nAfter being released from a twelve-step program, Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine had hired drummer Nick Menza and guitarist Marty Friedman to record Rust in Peace, creating what would become the band\'s first stable line-up, lasting to 1998. Bassist David Ellefson along with Mustaine were the only members who were not replaced. Rust in Peace was produced by Mike Clink, who previously co-operated with Whitesnake and Guns N\' Roses. Clink\'s job as producer contributed to the outcome of the record, with Mustaine being satisfied with the results. Mike Clink was also Megadeth\'s first professional producer.\n\nThe album\'s name comes from a bumper sticker (below) that Dave Mustaine, the band\'s main songwriter, saw on the back of a vehicle. From an interview with Mustaine:\n\n"I was driving home from Elsanon... um, Lake Elsanon. I was tailgating somebody, racing down the freeway, and I saw this bumper sticker on their car and it said... you know, this tongue in cheek stuff like, "One nuclear bomb could ruin your whole day," and then I looked on the other side and it said, "May all your nuclear weapons rust in peace," and I\'m goin\', "Rust in Peace. Damn, that\'s a good title." And I\'m thinkin\' like, "What do they mean, rust in peace?" I could just see it now―all these warheads sittin\' there, stockpiled somewhere like Seal Beach, you know, all covered with rust \'n\' stuff with kids out there spray-painting the stuff, you know."\n\nLyrical themes\n\nPolitics, warfare and the environment are the main topics explored throughout the album, with songs such as "Rust in Peace... Polaris," which is about intercontinental ballistic missiles, and their effects on the world (Polaris refers to Polaris missile); "Take No Prisoners," which is about prisoners of war; and "Holy Wars...The Punishment Due," which is a two-part song containing "Holy Wars," which is not referring to any historical place or event  and "The Punishment Due," which is about the Marvel Comics character The Punisher, of which Mustaine was a huge fan at the time. "Dawn Patrol" is about the environment being destroyed by global warming and greenhouse gases.\n\n"Five Magics" references to the obscure fantasy film Goreblade: Warrior King of the Universe, in which the hero who lives by the sword must master the five magics to become Warrior King and marry the princess, although he is warned that the power could corrupt him as it did the previous master.\n\nMusical content\n\nThe album is, barring the exception of the brief "Dawn Patrol", highly technical and progressive thrash metal, comparable to the work the band\'s peers Metallica had been releasing around the same time. The album has been cited as a particular influence on the development of progressive metal, and is sometimes considered to belong to the genre itself. While only one song tops the six-minute mark, many songs go through several time signature, tempo, or key signature changes and are comprised of multiple sections.\n\n"Dawn Patrol", the one piece that does not qualify as thrash metal, is a brief, midtempo piece with spoken word vocals written by bass guitarist David Ellefson.\n\nReception\n\nRust in Peace debuted at #23 on the Billboard 200 in the US, and #8 in the UK.\n\nAllmusic cited Rust in Peace as "Megadeth\'s strongest musical effort".\n\nThe album was certified Platinum in 1994, and received Grammy nominations in 1991 and 1992 for Best Metal Performance.\n\nIGN named Rust in Peace the 4th most influential heavy metal album of all time, after Metallica\'s Master of Puppets, Black Sabbath\'s Paranoid and Iron Maiden\'s The Number of the Beast.\n\nRemaster\n\nIn 2002, Mustaine remastered the debut Megadeth album, Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!. Inspired by the positive outcome of the re-release, he worked to remaster all of the subsequent Megadeth albums which had been recorded with Capitol Records (up to 1999\'s Risk).\n\nRust in Peace was re-released in 2004 with a new sound and four new bonus tracks. During the audio mixing process, Mustaine found that the original lead vocal tracks for "Take No Prisoners", "Five Magics" and "Lucretia" were missing — he had no choice but to re-record the vocals on "Take No Prisoners" and use alternate takes for "Lucretia" and "Five Magics" and possibly "Rust in Peace - Polaris" as the second verse differs from the original slightly.\n\nCover\n\nThe album\'s artwork was created by longtime Megadeth artist Ed Repka. It shows band mascot Vic Rattlehead and the leaders of the five major world powers (at the time) attending a secret meeting in Hangar 18, with Vic in the foreground presiding over the body of an alien.\n\nThe world leaders, from left to right, are former British Prime Minister John Major, former Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, former German President Richard von Weizsäcker, former Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, and former American President George H. W. Bush.\n\nCorrect track listing:\n\n1. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due - 6:36\n2. Hangar 18 - 5:14\n3. Take No Prisoners - 3:29\n4. Five Magics - 5:43\n5. Poison Was the Cure - 2:59\n6. Lucretia - 3:59\n7. Tornado of Souls - 5:23\n8. Dawn Patrol - 1:50\n9. Rust in Peace...Polaris - 5:38 <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Megadeth/Rust+In+Peace">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? is the second studio album by American thrash metal band Megadeth, released on September 19, 1986. The project was originally handled by Combat Records, resulting in the first mix of the album being co-produced by Randy Burns. Capitol Records then bought the rights to the album and hired another producer, Paul Lani, to mix it himself. The album's front cover, featuring the band's mascot Vic Rattlehead, was created by Ed Repka. The recording of the album was difficult for the band because of the ongoing drug issues the members had at the time. This was the last Megadeth album to feature drummer Gar Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland released from the group shortly after the album's promotional tour. The title track, noted for its politically charged lyrics, was released as the album's lead single.\n\nPeace Sells... but Who's Buying? is regarded as a thrash metal classic and as an album that gave prominence to extreme metal. It has been featured in several publications' best album lists, including Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die and Martin Popoff's Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time. The album has been reissued several times over the years. In 2004, the album was remixed and remastered by Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine, with extensive liner notes detailing the album's background. In 2011, the three different versions were reissued as part of the album's 25th-anniversary celebration. All of them, with the exception of the 2004 mixes, feature new remastering. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Megadeth/Peace+Sells...But+Who%27s+Buying%3F\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'The Number of the Beast is the third studio album by British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. The album was released on March 29, 1982 through EMI. This was the debut of vocalist Bruce Dickinson in Iron Maiden. Number of the Beast has been cited as one of the most influential heavy metal albums of all-time, and is widely acknowledged as one of the best and most iconic albums of the genre.\n\nThe Number of the Beast also cemented Iron Maiden as one of "the biggest metal bands on the planet".\n\nOf all the songs in the album, "The Number of the Beast", "Run to the Hills" and "Hallowed Be Thy Name" remain on the set lists of nearly all of the band\'s concert tours, with the latter two often used to close a show. All three songs have been released as singles in various forms.\n\nThe Beast on the Road was the tour supporting the album.\n\n\n History\nThe Number of the Beast marked Bruce Dickinson\'s debut with the band. Though the recording process was successful, it was plagued with bizarre events - during the making of the album, record producer Martin Birch had been in an accident and crashed his car into one driven by a "religious nutter" on a rainy Sunday evening. When he got his car back from the mechanic the bill came back in the exact amount of £666.66. Birch, "terrified", demanded the bill be rounded up to £667. Also, the title track reached number 18 in the UK charts - the sum of three sixes. Other stories about various strange occurrences at the recording studio have circulated, such as equipment randomly breaking down and lights turning off and on by themselves.\n\nSince this album (and its tour, Beast on the Road), "The Beast" has become something of a nickname for the band and possibly Eddie, as suggested by albums such as Best of the Beast (which featured a \'best of Eddie\' mural on the cover), Beast over Hammersmith, and the DVD Visions of the Beast.\n\nThis album is the only one to feature songwriting by drummer Clive Burr. This is one of several reasons why the album was so different from previous ones other than the obvious change in lead singer. It was the first album with writing by Adrian Smith (see below track listing for details), and the first to feature writing by the \'new\' Steve Harris (his older style had been written for different musicians, and in a different time) - the entire writing system was different. However, it is one of the few albums not to feature a Dave Murray song, and the first album not to feature an instrumental.\n\n\nReception\nIt was widely panned by mainstream media upon its release, including Rolling Stone, who claimed that it "blusters along aimlessly, proving again that bad music is hell."\n\nIt was also panned by social conservatives, especially in America. Due to its title, Iron Maiden was called a "Satanic band" in the US. Their Beast on the Road tour was marred by boycotts and protests.\n\nHowever, as time passed by, The Number of the Beast became one of the most critically acclaimed metal albums of all time, and was more accepted after the band became more mainstream.\n\nAllmusic said: "The Number of the Beast is quite simply one of the best heavy metal albums ever released."\n\nThe album was ranked number 17 on Guitar World\'s list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q magazine placed the album at number 100 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever, and a year later the same magazine named it as one of the 50 Heaviest Albums Of All Time. The BBC made a documentary of this album in their Classic Albums series.\n\nIGN named it the third greatest heavy metal album of all time.\n\nMetal-Rules.com named this the second greatest heavy metal album of all time.\n\nThe album is also a part of EMI\'s "Albums That Shaped Rock History" series.\n\n\nAlbum artwork\nThe album was also the centre of controversy, particularly in America, due to the lyrics of the title track and the cover art depicting Satan being controlled by Eddie. This cover art was originally intended for an earlier single, "Purgatory", but the band felt the cover was too high of caliber for just a single and a less complex image was used for the single instead. The title track, "Number of the Beast", was said not be a satanic song was actually instead inspired by bass player Steve Harris\'s nightmares about dabbling in Satanism. The album\'s cover art has been parodied several times - by crossover thrash band Stormtroopers of Death for the cover art of their 1999 album Bigger Than the Devil, and on a T-shirt by underground New York Hip Hop Label Uncle Howie Records *Streetwear brand Diamond Supply Co. parodied the album cover for a shirt in their line. Nick Tershay, founder of Diamond is reported as having had to pay $50,000 due to the parody being too close to the original art work.\n\nThe original 1982 artwork includes a light blue sky in the background; this was a mistake by the printers of the album cover, and was later rectified and became black when the album was remastered for compact disc in 1998.\n\n\n Lyrical themes\nWhile the title track was thought by many to be an assumption Iron Maiden were Satanists, in fact the song was inspired by a nightmare bassist Steve Harris had, triggered by watching the film Damien: Omen II late at night. While he was quite scared of the Satanic images he saw in his nightmare, he also felt them amusing, and after that, he obtained the idea for the song, and also for the title of the album.\n\n\n"Children of the Damned" is based on the films Village of the Damned and Children of the Damned, which in turn were adapted from the novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham. On a recent "Bruce Dickinson Rock Show" on BBC Radio 6, Dickinson told Ronnie James Dio that Children of the Damned was inspired by "Children of the Sea".\n\n"The Prisoner" was inspired by the British TV show of the same name, and features dialogue from its title sequence. Rod Smallwood had to telephone Patrick McGoohan to ask permission to use the dialogue for the song. According to witnesses the usually calm Smallwood was completely star struck during the conversation. McGoohan was reported to have said "What did you say the name was? Iron Maiden? Do it." Iron Maiden later made another song based on the series, "Back in the Village" from Powerslave.\n\n"22 Acacia Avenue" is the second song in the "Charlotte the Harlot" saga.\n\nThe title track opens with a spoken introduction which draws heavily from the King James Version of Revelation 13:18, and is apparently inspired by Tam o\' Shanter by Robert Burns. Barry Clayton is the name of the actor who speaks those opening lines on the album.\n\n\nClassic Albums\n \nThe cover for DVD, Classic Albums: The Number of the Beast.The making of the album was released as a video on December 4, 2001 through Eagle Visions, as part of the documentary series, Classic Albums.\n\n\nThe video was directed by Tim Kirkby and featured cuts from the title track, "Children of the Damned", "Run to the Hills", and "The Prisoner". In addition, extended interviews and live footage of "Hallowed Be Thy Name" —recorded during the band\'s performance at the Rock in Rio festval in 2001— were included.\n\nThe video reached number 9 on the Norwegian DVD Charts,[6] and was certifed Gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association.\n\nIt was released in DVD, VHS and UMD formats, and featured subtitles in six different languages, Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and French.\n\n Appearance in media\nOn October 24, 2002, progressive metal outfit Dream Theater played the original album in its entirety at La Mutualite in Paris, France. The performance was recorded and has been released through the band\'s YtseJam Records label.\n\n"Run To The Hills" was covered on the all-star tribute album Numbers From The Beast, featuring vocalist Robin McAuley, guitarists Michael Schenker and Pete Fletcher, bassist Tony Franklin, and drummer Brian Tichy. The version slightly varied from the original, in terms of guitars, when Schenker added small solos.\n\n"Hallowed Be Thy Name" was covered by Machine Head on the Maiden Heaven: A Tribute To Iron Maiden tribute album released by Kerrang! magazine in 2008.\n\nThe album has also been used in several video games - "Run To The Hills" is featured on SSX On Tour as the opening theme, and a cover version is a track in Rock Band in which it is the only song on the disk listed as an \'Impossible\' song for all the instruments. "The Number Of The Beast" is included as a master track in Guitar Hero III: Legends Of Rock while a cover version is downloadable for Rock Band. Incidentally, both Guitar Hero III and Rock Band spoofed "22 Acacia Avenue"; in Guitar Hero III: Legends Of Rock, the first venue is 22 Arcadia Avenue and Rock Band features a venue located at 22 Acadia Avenue.\n\n\nTrack listing\nOriginal track listing \n# Title Writer(s) Length \n1.

It was awarded platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and received a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on October 4, 1983.

            'A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second album by the Norwegian black metal band, Darkthrone. It was released in February 1992 and contains the band\'s first black metal recordings.\n\nDue to Darkthrone\'s sudden change from death metal to black metal, Peaceville Records was reluctant to release the album in its original form. The band then threatened to release it through Deathlike Silence Productions, the record label owned by Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth. However, Peaceville eventually agreed to release the album as it was recorded. In an interview, Fenriz said that the album was somewhat "rushed" as half of the songs feature "death metal guitar riffs" simply played in a "black metal style".\n\nBassist Dag Nilsen left the band before the recording of the album, but agreed to play session bass. This is the last recording featuring Dag Nilsen on bass guitar. The person who appears on the front cover is Ivar Enger (Zephyrous), the band\'s rhythm guitarist.\n\nThe album was remastered and reissued by Peaceville in 2003, as well as being repackaged in a cardboard digipak. The second chapter of a four-part video interview (spanning the first four albums) between Fenriz and Nocturno Culto was also included as bonus material.\n\nAll the releases of A Blaze in the Northern Sky have a note saying "This album is eternally dedicated to the king of death/black metal Euronymous."\n\nLine-up:\nNocturno Culto - Vocals, Lead Guitar\nZephyrous - Rhythm Guitar\nDag Nilsen - Bass Guitar (Session)\nFenriz - Drums <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Darkthrone/A+Blaze+in+the+Northern+Sky">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The guys from Birmingham, England shocked, scared and enthused million with their new sound - a blend of bluesy, soulful riffs with heavy, distorted tones. \n\nReleased on Friday the 13th February 1970 by Vertigo Records, Black Sabbath reached number eight on the UK Album Chart. Following its US release in May 1970 by Warner Bros. Records, the album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, where it remained for over a year, selling a million copies.\n\nWhile the album was a commercial success, it was widely panned by critics. In a review for Rolling Stone magazine, rock critic Lester Bangs felt Sabbath was "just like Cream! But worse". Bangs dismissed Black Sabbath as a "a shuck—despite the murky songtitles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream cliches"\n\nIn 2003, the album was ranked number 238 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nQ magazine (8/00, p.126) later included it as one of the Best Metal Albums of All Time, claiming that "[This] was to prove so influential it remains a template for metal bands three decades on. The band\'s signature song remains the scariest of all heavy metal songs."\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nEuropean edition\n\n   1. "Black Sabbath" – 6:16\n   2. "The Wizard" – 4:24\n   3.

            'Spirit of Eden is the fourth album by the English New wave band Talk Talk, released in 1988 on Parlophone records. The album found neither critical acclaim nor commercial success on release but has since become a cult favourite.\n\nThe songs were mostly written by vocalist Mark Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene and the album was compiled from a lengthy recording process at London\'s Wessex Studios between 1987 and 1988. Often working in darkness, the band recorded many hours of improvised performances which were heavily edited and re-arranged into an album in mostly digital format. The songs contain elements of rock, jazz, classical and ambient music.\n\nCritics often view Spirit of Eden as a departure from Talk Talk\'s earlier and more accessible albums. Compared to their 1986 hit The Colour of Spring, it was a commercial disappointment. However a plurality of critical reviews laud the album.\n\nTalk Talk, led by singer Mark Hollis, formed in England in the early 1980s. From the start, Hollis cited jazz and classical artists like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Béla Bartók and Claude Debussy as major influences. But Talk Talk\'s first two albums, The Party\'s Over (1982) and It\'s My Life (1984), did not readily reflect such influences; critics compared the band to contemporary new wave groups, especially Duran Duran. Hollis partly attributes the shortcomings of their early music to a financial need to use synthesizers in place of acoustic instruments.\n\nAlthough critics did not favour the band\'s early output, the first two albums were commercially successful in Europe. This gave Talk Talk the money needed to hire additional musicians to play on their next album, The Colour of Spring (1986). The band no longer had to rely on synthesizers. Instead, musicians improvised with their instruments for many hours, then Hollis and producer Tim Friese-Greene edited and arranged the performances to get the sound they wanted. A total of sixteen musicians appeared on the album. The Colour of Spring became Talk Talk\'s most successful album, selling over two million copies and prompting a major world tour. At the same time, minimalist songs like "April 5th," "Chameleon Day," and the B-side "It\'s Getting Late in the Evening" pointed towards the band\'s next direction.\n\nFor the success of The Colour of Spring, EMI rewarded Talk Talk with an open budget and schedule for the recording of their next album, Spirit of Eden. Talk Talk were given complete control over the recording process; their manager and EMI executives were barred from studio sessions. Recording for Spirit of Eden began in 1987 at Wessex Studios, London and took about a year to complete.\n\nEngineer Phill Brown said that the album, along with its successor, was "recorded by chance, accident, and hours of trying every possible overdub idea."\n\nAlthough the album is noted for its tranquil soundscapes, Graham Sutton of Bark Psychosis notes "Noise is important. I could never understand people I knew who liked Talk Talk and saw it as something \'nice to chill out to\' when I loved the overwhelming intensity and the dynamics."\n\nMark Hollis\' lyrics reflect his religious and spiritual outlook. Though he acknowledges that his lyrics are religious, he says they are not based on a specific creed, preferring to think of them as "humanitarian."\n"I Believe in You" has been described as an "anti-heroin song." When asked whether the lyrics are based on personal experience, Hollis replied, "No, not at all. But, you know, I met people who got totally fucked up on it. Within rock music there\'s so much fucking glorification of it, and it is a wicked, horrible thing."\n\nSome music critics consider Spirit of Eden and its 1991 follow-up Laughing Stock influential to post-rock, a music genre that developed in Britain and North America in the 1990s. In a review of Bark Psychosis\' album Hex, where the term "post-rock" was coined, Simon Reynolds opined that Hex aspires to the "baroque grandeur" of Spirit of Eden. Andy Whitman of Paste magazine argues that Spirit of Eden represents the beginning of post-rock: "The telltale marks of the genre—textured guitars, glacial tempos, an emphasis on dynamics, electronica, ambience and minimalism—were all in place, and paved the way for bands like Sigur Rós, Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Low and latter-period Radiohead." Simon Harper of the Birmingham Post observed how "their combination of jazz, classical, rock and the spacey echoes of dub, using silence almost as an instrument in its own right, lends itself to the vernacular of post-rock, and there can be little argument that Tortoise and their Chicago-based compatriots would hardly sound the same were it not for the staggering achievements of Hollis and Tim Friese-Greene." Numerous bands and artists, including Graham Coxon, Doves and Elbow have praised Spirit of Eden or have cited it as an influence.\n\nIn 2008 Alan McGee wrote: "Spirit of Eden has not dated; it\'s remarkable how contemporary it sounds, anticipating post-rock, The Verve and Radiohead. It\'s the sound of an artist being given the keys to the kingdom and returning with art."\n\nAll songs written and composed by Tim Friese-Greene and Mark Hollis. \n\n1. "The Rainbow"   9:05\n2. "Eden"   6:37\n3. "Desire"   7:08\n4. "Inheritance"   5:16\n5. "I Believe in You"   6:24\n6.

            "Laughing Stock is the fifth and final LP from Talk Talk, released on November 19, 1991 from Polydor records. It marks the pinnacle of the band's transformation from synth-pop into an experimental, impressionistic sound that would later share characteristics with what music critics called post-rock; as such, it is the quintessential document of a proto-post-rock sound from this incredibly creative group, and it serves as a touchstone record for the era. Since it's release, many years later it has been hailed as a lost classic of the grunge-era nineties.\n\nTalk Talk had been steadily gestating a sound transformation from records in the late eighties before Laughing Stock, but those records lacked a cohesive, full production level to make their output from that era stand out as much as it could have. Since Laughing Stock has a much higher production value level, it is distinguishable from the earlier records, and generally serves as a reference to this band's greatest work. Much has been said of this record's seemingly singular identity; it tends to present itself as if it has its own world of sound. Elements of jazz, contemporary-classical, alternative rock and post-punk collude throughout the album to form a distinctly unique listening experience from start to finish. Despite all those present elements, this record defies easy categorization. It would influence later jazz-inflecting rock combos like Tortoise and Sea and Cake as they crafted similarly engrossing albums. \n\nIt is critically regarded as a top-notch record. Many publications have retroactively named it one of the best records of the nineties, albeit it was mostly ignored upon its initial release and for a while after that. Perhaps the pressure of the public's general ambivalence mixed with the demands of making such a creative work caused Talk Talk to disband, but they are nevertheless remembered now as essential listening, with Laughing Stock exalted above their other records. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Talk+Talk/Laughing+Stock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Loaded is the fourth album by The Velvet Underground, released in November 1970, by Atlantic Records\' subsidiary label, Cotillion. The album was the final album recorded featuring Lou Reed, though he had departed from the band shortly before the album\'s release. In 2003, Loaded was #109 on Rolling Stone\'s reissue of their 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nLoaded was a commercial effort aimed at radio play, another step away from the Warhol-influenced days. The album\'s title refers to Atlantic\'s request that the band produce an album "loaded with hits". Doug Yule said, "On Loaded there was a big push to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. And I think that the third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and if you listen to them you can hear the derivation, like this is sort of a Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song." <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Velvet+Underground/Loaded">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Doolittle is the second studio album from the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in April 1989 on 4AD. The album\'s offbeat and dark subject material, featuring references to surrealism, Biblical violence, torture and death, contrasts with the clean production sound achieved by the then newly hired producer Gil Norton. Along with Surfer Rosa, Doolittle is considered the band\'s strongest work.\n\nDoolittle has continued to sell consistently well in the nineteen years since its release, and in 1995 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album has been cited as inspirational by many alternative artists, while numerous music publications have ranked it as one of the most influential albums ever. A 2003 poll of NME writers ranked Doolittle as the second greatest album of all time. Reaction to Doolittle was positive in general, with the album garnering praise from several major music publications. NME commented that "the songs on Doolittle have the power to make you literally jump out of your skin with excitement." Q, giving the album four stars out of five, said that Doolittle\'s "carefully structured noise and straightforward rhythmic insistence makes perfect sense." Tim Rolston, of the Daily Telegraph praised Doolittle as "a scintillating rock\'n\'roll album" and the Pixies\' "finest half-hour so far." Other publications also awarded the album four out of five stars, including the British music weekly Record Mirror, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune. The Village Voice\'s Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ rating, suggesting that "getting famous too fast could ruin them."\n\nHowever, Doolittle received mixed reviews from several music critics. Time Out said that "Gil Norton\'s toy theatre production makes a drama out of what should have been a crisis." Spin ran a hundred-word review of the album, including critic Joe Levy\'s comment "the insanity less surreal and more silly, and the songs themselves more like songs and less like adventures." Rolling Stone, reviewing the album in July 1988, gave the album three and a half stars. Doolittle appeared on several end-of-year "Best Album" lists; both Rolling Stone and The Village Voice placed the album tenth, and independent music magazines Sounds and Melody Maker both ranked the album as the second best of the year. NME also ranked the album highly, placing it fourth in their end-of-year list.\n\nA range of music magazines have since acclaimed Doolittle as one of the quintessential alternative rock albums of the 1980s. Rolling Stone, reviewing Doolittle again in 2002, gave the album five stars out of five, remarking that it laid the "groundwork for Nineties rock." Doolittle has received a number of international accolades and is consistently noted as one of the best albums of the 1980s in any genre.\n\n\nFollowing its release, Doolittle sold steadily in America, and broke sales of 100,000 after six months. By early 1992, while the band were supporting U2 on their Zoo TV Tour, the album was selling 1,500 copies a week. The middle of 1993, two years after the band\'s last album, Trompe le Monde, saw sales average 1,200 copies per week. Doolittle was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1995. Ten years after the breakup, Doolittle was still selling between 500 and 1,000 copies a week; the reunion tour saw sales creep back up to 1,200 copies a week. At the end of 2005, best estimates put total sales in America at between 800,000 and one million copies.\n\nDoolittle features an eclectic mix of musical styles. While tracks such as "Tame" and "Crackity Jones" are fast and aggressive, and incorporate the band\'s trademark loud-quiet dynamic; other songs such as "Silver," "I Bleed," and "Here Comes Your Man" reveal a quieter, slower and more melodic temperament. With Doolittle, the band began to incorporate further instruments into their sound. "Monkey Gone to Heaven" features two violins and two cellos; while other tracks on Doolittle are constructed around simple chord progressions.\n\n"Tame" is based on a three chord formula; including Joey Santiago\'s playing a "Hendrix chord" over the main bass progression. "I Bleed" is melodically simple, and is formed around a single rhythmical repetition. Some songs are influenced by other genres of music; while "Crackity Jones" has a distinctly Spanish sound, and incorporates G# and A triads over a C# pedal, the song\'s rhythm guitar, played by Francis, starts with an eighth-note downstroke typical of punk rock music. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pixies/Doolittle">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "Surfer Rosa is the first full-length album by the American alternative rock band Pixies, released in March 1988 on the British independent record label 4AD. The album's unusual and offbeat subject matter includes references to mutilation and voyeurism; this is augmented by experimental recording, low-fidelity production and a distinctive drum sound. Surfer Rosa contains many of the elements present in the Pixies' earlier output, including Spanish lyrics and references to Puerto Rico. Because of 4AD's independent status, distribution in the United States was handled by British label Rough Trade Records; however, it failed to chart in either the UK or the U.S. \"Gigantic\" was the only single taken from the release, and only reached number 93 on the UK Singles Chart. Despite this, Surfer Rosa was re-released in the U.S. by Elektra Records in 1992, and in 2005 was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Surfer Rosa is often cited as a favorite of music critics, and is frequently included on professional lists of the all-time best rock albums. Many alternative rock artists, including Billy Corgan and PJ Harvey, have cited the album as inspirational; Nirvana's Kurt Cobain frequently acknowledged that Surfer Rosa was a strong influence on Nevermind, and in 1993 hired the album's producer Steve Albini to produce his band's album In Utero. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Pixies/Surfer+Rosa\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'The Stooges is the self-titled debut studio album by American rock band The Stooges. It was released in August 1969 on Elektra Records. Two songs, "I Wanna Be Your Dog" and "1969", were released as singles and the album peaked at number 106 on the Billboard album charts. It is widely considered one of the best proto-punk albums. With Ron Asheton\'s walls of distortion, and distorted wah wah solos, textures and power chord riffs it is also considered to have had an impact on hard rock.\n\nFor their first album, The Stooges had intended to record five songs: "I Wanna Be Your Dog", "No Fun", "1969", "Ann", and "We Will Fall". The five songs were staples of—and essentially the basis of—The Stooges\' live set at the time. A typical Stooges song of the period would involve two minutes of composed song followed by several minutes of improvisation. Presuming that the five songs as normally performed would cover requirements for the album, the Stooges were told by Elektra that they needed more material. According to Iggy Pop, "We handed (the five-song version of the album) in and they refused it. They said, \'There aren\'t enough songs!\' So we lied and said, \'That\'s OK, we\'ve got lots more songs.\'" (liner notes of 2005 reissue, p. 9)\n\nIn reality, the Stooges were about a day ahead of themselves when Iggy made that statement to Elektra; overnight, the group wrote three more songs, "Real Cool Time", "Not Right", and "Little Doll", and played them for the first time in the studio.\n\nAn initial mix by producer John Cale, apparently resembling ex-Velvet Underground bandmate Lou Reed\'s "closet mix" of that band\'s eponymous third album of the same year, was rejected by Elektra. The mix as heard on the final product was done by Iggy Pop and Elektra Records president Jac Holzman. Four of Cale\'s original mixes would later appear on the bonus disc of a 2005 re-issued version, with pitch correction applied to them. Five years later, all Cale mixes were released unaltered on the first disc of a 2010 collector\'s edition release of the album. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stooges/The+Stooges">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Progressive in texture for the most part, Supertramp\'s debut album became increasingly disregarded as they blossomed commercially through the \'70s. The album was the only one on which drummer Bob Miller and guitarist Richard Palmer appeared, replaced by Kevin Currie and Frank Farrell for the Indelibly Stamped release which surfaced a year later. Quite a bit different than their radio and AOR material, Supertramp is inundated with pretentious instrumental meandering, with greater emphasis and attention granted to the keyboards and guitars than to the writing and to the overall effluence of the music. There are some attractive moments, such as the mixture of ardor and subtlety that arises in "Words Unspoken," "Surely," and "Nothing to Show," and some of the fusion that erupts throughout the 12 minutes of "Try Again" is impressive even though the whole of the track results in one of the most extravagant and overblown pieces the band has ever produced. Hodgson\'s use of cello, flageolet, and acoustic guitar is endearing in spots, and while both he and Davies had just recently formed their alliance, it was evident that their songwriting was going to be one of the band\'s strengths. Ultimately dissatisfied with the results of the album, they retorted with Indelibly Stamped, which disappointingly followed suit. It wasn\'t until 1974\'s Crime of the Century that things began to improve for Supertramp, when they replaced Farrell and Currie with saxman John Helliwell, bass player Dougie Thompson, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Supertramp/Supertramp">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Swift began preparing for the album during the same year which Red was released, and during a significant amount of media scrutiny. Over the course of the two-year songwriting period, she primarily collaborated with producers Max Martin and Shellback—Martin served as the album\'s executive producer alongside Swift. Named after Swift\'s birth year, the album\'s title was inspired by the pop music scene of the 1980s.\n\nThe album represents a departure from the country music of her previous albums, and is described by Swift as her "first documented official pop album." In contrast to Swift\'s previous work, the production of 1989 consists of drum programming, synthesizers, pulsating bass, processed backing vocals, and guitars. 1989 received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics and it was ranked as one of the best albums of 2014 by several publications, including Billboard, Time, and Rolling Stone. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/1989+(Deluxe)">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Red is the fourth studio album by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. It was released on October 22, 2012 through Big Machine Records, as the follow-up to her commercially successful 2010 album Speak Now. It was announced through Swift\'s live webchat on August 13, 2012, in which she revealed the album title, album cover, as well as answered fan questions. Four promotional singles were released in the month leading up to the album release, three of which debuted inside the top ten of the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. The album features collaborations with new producers and guest artists such as Gary Lightbody and Ed Sheeran, and sees Swift experimenting with new musical genres.\n\nThe album\'s lead single, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" was a worldwide commercial success, topping the iTunes charts all over the world and sold 623,000 copies in the first week, becoming Swift\'s first ever Billboard Hot 100 chart-topper after vaulting from 72 to number one and stayed at top for three weeks. Even though she usually doesn\'t discuss who her songs are about, Swift told Broadway\'s Electric Barnyard that she would agree to disclose the inspiration for "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" for a six figure donation to charity. Following in the footsteps of one of her idol\'s, whom she mimics quite often, Carly Simon.\n\nThe second single, "Begin Again" was released in October 1. Red has also spawned three other promotional singles, all of them reached top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Red has been mostly acclaimed by music critics, who praised Swift\'s versatility as a musician and enjoyed her experiments with new music genres. Red sold 1,208,000 copies in its first week in the U.S, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, and scored the highest number one debut in the US for the 2010s decade so far. Red is also Swift\'s first chart-topper in the U.K., and also topped the album charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/Red">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Norman Fucking Rockwell! is the sixth studio album by American singer and songwriter Lana Del Rey. It was released on August 30, 2019, by Polydor and Interscope Records. The album was primarily produced by Del Rey and Jack Antonoff, with additional contributions from Zach Dawes, Andrew Watt and longtime Del Rey collaborator Rick Nowels.\n\nMusically, Norman Fucking Rockwell! features a soft rock sound consisting of psych-rock jams and piano ballads, and features references to various classic rock artists. The name of the album is a reference to the painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell.\n\nThe first singles from the album, "Mariners Apartment Complex" and "Venice Bitch", were released in September 2018, followed by "Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman like Me to Have – but I Have It", "Doin\' Time", "The Greatest", and "Norman Fucking Rockwell" in 2019.\n\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! received widespread critical acclaim, and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, while the title track was nominated for Song of the Year. It was listed by several publications as one of the best albums of the decade, and in the years following its release, of all time. To promote the album, Del Rey embarked on a concert tour, titled The Norman Fucking Rockwell! Tour.\n\nDel Rey announced she had begun working on a follow up material to 2017\'s Lust for Life in January 2018. Del Rey confirmed she had been working on songs including one titled "Bartender", but did not know if it would be featured on an album. In September 2018, Del Rey revealed that the album was nearly complete, and that she had recorded eleven tracks for it.  In a September 2019 livestream on Instagram, Del Rey announced that the album was almost named Bird World.\n\nFLOOD Magazine described the album\'s sound as "a mellow soft rock" and noted that Del Rey\'s improved lyrics tackle larger themes than her previous work.[14] According to critics, Norman Fucking Rockwell! features "psych-rock jams" and piano-based ballads.[5][15] Consequence of Sound described the record as featuring "psych-pop lullabies, tales of complicated, consuming romantic love, and overt odes to the tarnished dream of California."[16] It has been characterised as a "pop classic",[17] as well as embodying folk rock,[18][19] and existing somewhere between the desert rock and "minimalist" trip hop of Del Rey\'s previous efforts.[20]\n\nThe album features a strong influence from \'70s classic rock.[6] Kitty Empire of The Observer noted that "strings and synth washes soundtrack multiple love songs", and also noted several classic rock references throughout the album, including Neil Young\'s "Cinnamon Girl", Crosby, Stills, & Nash, and Led Zeppelin\'s Houses of the Holy.[21] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the album\'s "Laurel Canyon \'70s soft-rock fantasies", including references to Joni Mitchell and the Eagles.[17]\n\nNo Ripcord describes Norman Fucking Rockwell! as "a remarkably sharp pop record that retains her fascination with pop-culture iconography and the rosey simplicity of a post-war America where classic rock and blue jeans ruled and takes them to much deeper places".[22]\n\nThe album\'s cover art, release date, and track listing were announced by Del Rey on July 31, 2019.[23] The cover art features Del Rey and Duke Nicholson—actor Jack Nicholson\'s grandson—posing on a sailboat, with the album title and Del Rey\'s initials written in a comic-inspired style.[24] The photo was taken by Del Rey\'s sister, photographer Chuck Grant.[25] The following day, Del Rey released an album trailer.[26] On August 2, Urban Outfitters announced an exclusive vinyl of the album featuring an alternative album artwork.[27] The alternative cover was also shot by Chuck Grant.[28]\n\nThroughout 2018, Del Rey shared snippets via social media of several songs intended for the album, including "Happiness Is a Butterfly",[29] "How to Disappear",[30] and "Cinnamon Girl".[31] She performed "How to Disappear" on October 29 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, debuting the full song for the first time.[32] A trailer for the album was released on August 1, 2019. It features three of the album\'s singles—"Doin\' Time", "Mariners Apartment Complex", and "Venice Bitch"—as well as the title track.[33] On August 22, 2019, "Fuck It, I Love You" and "The Greatest" were released as promotional singles along with a double music video. The music video runs at 9:19 minutes long, with the same shoot as the album trailer.\n\n"Mariners Apartment Complex" was released as the album\'s first single on September 12, 2018.[34]\n\nThe following week, on September 18, Del Rey released the second single, "Venice Bitch" and revealed the album title.[35]\n\n"Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman like Me to Have – but I Have It" followed as the third single on January 9, 2019.[36]\n\nDel Rey released a cover of Sublime\'s "Doin\' Time" on May 17, 2019, for a documentary about the band.[37] It also served as the fourth single from the album. The music video was released on August 29, 2019, one day before the release of her upcoming album; "Norman Fucking Rockwell!".\n\nA double music video for "Fuck It I Love You" and "The Greatest" was released on August 22, 2019. They both served as two promotional singles. "The Greatest" was later released as the album\'s fifth single on September 13, 2019, in Italy.\n\n"Norman Fucking Rockwell", the title track, was released on November 1, 2019 in the UK as the sixth and final single of this era\n\nOn August 1, 2019, Del Rey announced two legs of a tour in promotion of Norman Fucking Rockwell!. The first leg took place in North America in the fall of 2019,[38] and the second in Europe in early 2020.[39] The European leg of the tour was subsequently cancelled due to illness.[40]\n\nOn December 20, 2019, Del Rey released a 14-minute-long short film featuring the songs "Norman Fucking Rockwell", "Bartender", and "Happiness is a Butterfly". The film was directed by Chuck Grant and premiered on YouTube.\n\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! received widespread acclaim from music critics and is also the most critically acclaimed studio album of Del Rey\'s career to date. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87 based on 28 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[43]\n\nJenn Pelly of Pitchfork wrote that the album "establishes [Del Rey] as one of America’s greatest living songwriters".[19] In his review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield wrote that "the long-awaited Norman Fucking Rockwell is even more massive and majestic than everyone hoped it would be. Lana turns her fifth and finest album into a tour of sordid American dreams, going deep cover in all our nation\'s most twisted fantasies of glamour and danger."[17] He concluded that Del Rey "has finally made her pop classic."[17] In a five-star review for NME, Rhian Daly called the album "nothing short of stunning."[47] Kristel Jax of Now wrote that "Del Rey has shifted her kitschy patriotic fixation, dropping her flag-draped persona and making peace with a more complex, dystopian reality", also giving the album five stars.[49] For Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani described the album as being "a heady collection of psych-rock and piano dirges that pour into each other and rarely shift tempo from track to track" as well as "frank assessments of the psychic effects of a world spiraling into chaos."[15] Also writing positively, Alexandra Pollard of The Independent wrote that "The album is sultry and soporific, sitting somewhere between the minimalist trip-hop of Del Rey’s early days, and the scuzzy desert rock she has toyed with over the years," and concluded that "This is Del Rey at her most assertive."[20] In his \'premature evaluation\' for Stereogum, Tom Breihan wrote that the album is "a beautiful opus for a new dark age — a fond look back at the world we just wrecked", calling it "yoga music for the apocalypse."[50]\n\nIn a more mixed review, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the album as "an alternately beguiling and frustrating experience", concluding that despite Del Rey\'s evident talent, "it’s hard not to wish that she would broaden her perspective, adopt a different persona, shake things up a little."[46] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph similarly wrote that the album "reveals Del Rey to be something of a one trick pony, but what a beautiful trick it is\n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with 104,000 album-equivalent units, of which 66,000 were pure album sales, making it Del Rey\'s sixth US top ten album.[109] In its second week, the album dropped to number nine with 35,000 units.[110]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number one with 31,539 copies, becoming her best first week sales in the country since Ultraviolence.[111][112] The album became Lana Del Rey\'s fourth number one album in the UK tying Taylor Swift as the female artist with the most solo number one albums in the UK during the 2010s.[113] In France, the album sold 8,000 copies in its first week, 800 more than Lust for Life\'s first week\n\nLana Del Rey – vocals, horns (9)\nJack Antonoff – keyboards (1–4, 6–8, 11, 13), piano (1–4, 6–8, 11, 13, 14), drums (2–4, 8, 11), programming (2–4, 6–8, 11, 13), acoustic guitar (2–4, 8, 11), electric guitar (2–4, 6–8, 11, 13), synthesizers (3), percussion (8), vibraphone (8)\nEvan Smith – saxophone (1, 11), flute (11)\nPhillip Peterson – baritone (1), cello (1, 6, 11), flugelhorn (1)\nVictoria Parker – violin (1, 6, 11)\nLaura Sisk – additional programming (2)\nChad Smith - drums (4)\nMikey Freedom Hart – keyboards (4), Mellotron (9), piano (9), drums (10), programming (10)\nAndrew Watt – instrumentation (5), programming (5), guitar (5)\nEric Wilson – bass guitar (5)\nJosh Freese – drums (5)\nBud Gaugh – drums (5)\nGale Levant – harp (5)\nWoozy Biff – harp (9)\nZachary Dawes – piano (9)\nLoren Humphrey – drums (9)\nDarren Weiss – drums (9)\nMike Riddleberger – drums (9)\nSean Hutchinson – drums (9)\nEvan Weiss – guitar (9)\nBenji Lysaght – guitar (9)\nTyler Parkford – Hammond B3 (9)\nDean Reid – bass guitar (9), keyboards (10), guitar (10), FX (10), programming (10)\nKieron Menzies – Mellotron (9), drums (10), FX (10), programming (10)\nRick Nowels – keyboards (10), acoustic guitar (10), piano (12)\nGrace Wang – keyboards (1)\nZac Rae – keyboards (10)\nDavid Levita – guitar (10)\n\n <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/Norman+Fucking+Rockwell%21">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Kevin Parker started writing and recording new material for Lonerism almost immediately after releasing Innerspeaker, saying "I started writing songs straight after Innerspeaker, but I told myself I wouldn\'t get hung up with the pressure, so I kinda pretended they were for some other weird project that wasn\'t going to have as much consequence". While Innerspeaker was recorded in a very structured manner with a designated time period to record, Parker recorded Lonerism in many different places around the world whilst touring with Tame Impala. Speaking about this, Parker revealed "I\'ve got a recording thing with me at the moment, I can do vocal takes and guitar takes wherever I am, so it\'s getting recorded all over the world. There\'s a guitar take in Vienna, or a vocal take in the aeroplane from Singapore to London. I\'ve got my studio at home, so a lot is being done in Perth." <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala/Lonerism">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            "Currents is the third studio album by Australian psychedelic rock act Tame Impala, released on 17 July 2015 on Interscope Records. Like the group's previous two albums, Currents was written, recorded, performed, and produced by primary member Kevin Parker. For the first time, Parker also mixed the music. It was also the first time that Parker recorded all instruments by himself; the album featured no other collaborations.\n\nAfter releasing the group's previous record, Lonerism (2012), Parker began work on Currents, largely recording at his home studio in Fremantle. He engrossed himself with writing and recording, and owing to his reputation as a musical auteur, labored over the details of each song, ultimately causing the release date to be delayed by two months. In contrast to the psychedelic rock sound of the project's prior work, Currents marks a shift to more dance-oriented music, with more emphasis placed on synthesizers than guitars. Parker was inspired to seek a change out of desire to hear Tame Impala's music played in dance clubs and a more communal setting. Thematically, the record is about the process of personal transformation, which many critics interpreted to be the result of a romantic break-up. The album's cover art depicting vortex shedding is a visualization of these themes.\n\nCurrents was preceded by the singles Let It Happen, Cause I'm a Man, Disciples and Eventually. Like its predecessors, the album received critical acclaim. It became the group's best charting release, debuting at number one in Australia, number three in the United Kingdom, and number four in the United States. At the 2015 ARIA Music Awards, Currents was awarded \"Best Rock Album\" and \"Album of the Year\", among other honors that Tame Impala received. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala/Currents\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill is the debut solo album studio by Lauryn Hill. Released August 25, 1998, the album swept the Grammy Awards in 1999, being nominated for 10 and winning five. As of 2009, the album has sold over 19 million copies worldwide and over 10 million copies in the US alone, with the RIAA giving it Diamond status .\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1997, Hill began production on an album that would eventually become The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. The title was partially inspired by The Education of Sonny Carson, a film and autobiographical novel about a troubled African American youth. The album includes collaborations with soul singer D\'Angelo on "Nothing Even Matters", guitarist Carlos Santana on "To Zion", singer Mary J. Blige on "I Used to Love Him"; as well as then little-known John Legend playing the piano on "Everything is Everything". Songs for the album were largely written in an attic studio in South Orange, New Jersey and recorded at Chung King Studios in Jamaica. Wyclef Jean, Hill\'s bandmate with The Fugees, initially didn\'t support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered his production help; Hill declined his assistance.\n\nSeveral songs on the album concerned her frustrations with The Fugees; "I Used to Love Him" dealt with the break-down of the relationship between Hill and Wyclef Jean. "To Zion" spoke about her decision to have her first baby, even though many at the time encouraged her to abort the pregnancy as to not interfere with her blossoming career.\n\nThe Miseducation contained several interludes of a teacher speaking to what is implied to be a classroom of children; in fact, the "teacher" was played by Ras Baraka (a poet, educator and politician) speaking to a group of kids in the living room of Hill\'s New Jersey home. The singer requested that Baraka speak to the children about the concept of love, and he improvised the lecture.\n\n1998 saw the release of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which was both critically and commercially successful. The landmark concept album set new records for black women, female hip-hop artists, and women in general. It sold over 423,000 copies in its first week and topped the Billboard 200 albums chart for four weeks and the Billboard R&B Album chart for six weeks; it would go on to sell more than 18 million copies over the next decade. The first single off the album was "Lost Ones" (US #27), released in Spring 1998. The second was "Doo Wop (That Thing)", which reached #1 in the billboard charts. Other singles released in support of the album were "Ex-Factor" (US #21), "Everything Is Everything" (US #35), and "To Zion".\n\nAt the 1999 Grammy Awards, Hill was nominated ten times , becoming the first female ever to be nominated ten times in one year: Hill won five Grammys including Album of the Year, Best R&B Album, Best R&B Song, Best Female R&B Vocal Performance, and Best New Artist. Lauryn Hill set a new record in the industry, as she became the first woman to win five Grammys in one night. Between 1998 and 1999, Hill earned $25 million from record sales and touring.\n\nHill became a national media icon, as magazines ranging from Time to Esquire to Teen People vied to put her on the cover. By the end of the year, as the album topped virtually every major music critic\'s best-of list, she was being credited for helping fully assimilate hip-hop into mainstream music.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Hill was noted by some as a humanitarian. In 1996 she received an Essence Award for work which has included the 1996 founding of the Refugee Project, an outreach organization that supports a two-week overnight camp for at-risk youth, and for supporting well-building projects in Kenya and Uganda, as well as for staging a rap concert in Harlem to promote voter registration. In 1999 Hill received three awards at the 30th Annual NAACP Image Awards. In 1999 Ebony named her one of "100+ Most Influential Black Americans". She was named with Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. and others among the "10 For Tomorrow," in the EBONY 2000: Special Millennium Issue.\n\nIn 2003, VH1 named it the 37th greatest album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 312 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Chris Rock ranked it 23rd in his 2005 list of the Top 25 Hip-Hop Albums of all time. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly named " The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill" second on the greatest albums in the past 25 years.\n\nLawsuit\n\nThough The Miseducation was largely a collaborative work between Hill and a group of musicians known as New Ark (Vada Nobles, Rasheem Pugh, Tejumold and Johari Newton), there was "label pressure to do the Prince thing," wherein all tracks would be credited as "written and produced by" the artist with little outside help. While recording the album, when Hill was asked about providing contracts or documentation to the musicians, she replied, "We all love each other. This ain\'t about documents. This is blessed."\n\nIn 1998, New Ark filed a fifty-page lawsuit against Hill, her management, and her record label, stating that Hill "used their songs and production skills but failed to properly credit them for the work." The musicians claimed that they either wrote or produced 13 of 14 tracks on Miseducation , despite the liner notes of the album claiming that it was "produced, written, arranged and performed by Lauryn Hill." New Ark requested partial writing credits and monetary reimbursement.[12] The suit was settled out of court in February 2001 for a reported $5 million.\n\nNew Ark\'s lawyer, Peter C. Harvey, scoffed at Hill\'s image as a prolific songwriter. “She is not a musician, she is not a producer...I dare say if you put Lauryn Hill in a studio alone, she couldn’t do it again." . In a 2005 Interview, Lauryn responded saying " I am a Songwriter, Producer and a Musician and that I gave people too much credit that they didn\'t truly deserve. I can do it again, because I am a Artist thats speaks from my heart and from my mind. If people benefit off my new music to come then so be it, I will only make music to give information to my own children".\n\nAs of 2009, Hill has released only one album after Miseducation - 2001\'s MTV Unplugged No. 2.0 - which sold a fraction of Miseducation\'s numbers.\n <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Lauryn+Hill/The+Miseducation+of+Lauryn+Hill">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'In a Silent Way is a studio album by American jazz musician Miles Davis, released July 30, 1969 on Columbia Records. Produced by Teo Macero, the album was recorded in one session date on February 18, 1969 at CBS 30th Street Studio B in New York City. Incorporating elements of classical sonata form, Macero edited and arranged Davis\'s recordings from the session to produce the album. Marking the beginning of his "electric" period, In a Silent Way has been regarded by music writers as Davis\'s first fusion recording, following a stylistic shift toward the genre in his previous records and live performances.\n\nUpon its release, the album was met by controversy among music critics, particularly those of jazz and rock music, who were divided in their reaction to its experimental musical structure and Davis\'s electronic approach. Since its initial reception, it has been regarded by fans and critics as one of Davis\'s greatest and most influential works. In 2001, Columbia Legacy and Sony Music released the three-disc box set The Complete In a Silent Way Sessions, which includes the original album, additional tracks, and the unedited recordings used to produce In a Silent Way.\n\nAlthough Davis\'s live performances and previous records such as Miles in the Sky (1968) and Filles de Kilimanjaro (1969) had indicated his stylistic shift to fusion, In a Silent Way featured a full-blown electric approach by Davis. It has been regarded by music writers as the first of Davis\'s fusion recordings, while marking the beginning of his "electric" period. It is also the first recording by Davis that was largely constructed by the editing and arrangement of producer Teo Macero. Macero\'s editing techniques have incorporated elements of classical sonata form in Davis\' recordings for In a Silent Way. Both of the extended tracks on the album consist of three distinct parts that could be thought of as an exposition, development and recapitulation. The last six minutes of the first track are actually the first six minutes of the same track repeated in exactly the same form. With this "trick" the track takes on a more understandable structure.\n\nThe album featured virtuoso guitarist and newcomer John McLaughlin, who had one month prior to the February 18th In a Silent Way session recorded his classic debut album Extrapolation. At the request of Tony Williams, McLaughlin moved in early February from England to the US to play with The Tony Williams Lifetime. Williams brought McLaughlin to Davis\' house the night before the scheduled session for In a Silent Way. Davis had not heard the guitarist before, but was so impressed that he told him to show up at the studio the next day. McLaughlin would go on to great fame in the 1970s as leader of the Mahavishnu Orchestra.\n\nAccording to producer Bob Belden, organist Larry Young, whom Williams had also recently hired for his Lifetime trio, was also intended to play on In a Silent Way. However, out of fear that he would lose his entire band to Davis, Williams sent Young home as soon as he arrived. Instead Joe Zawinul, who had come to the session only as the composer of the song "In a Silent Way," ended up playing organ on the album. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/In+A+Silent+Way">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Bitches Brew is a studio double album by jazz musician Miles Davis, released in April 1970 on Columbia Records. The album continued his experimentation with electric instruments previously featured on his critically acclaimed In a Silent Way album. With the use of these instruments, such as the electric piano and guitar, Davis rejected traditional jazz rhythms in favor of a looser, rock-influenced improvisational style.\n\nBitches Brew was Davis\'s first gold record, selling more than half a million copies. Upon release, it received a mixed response, due to the album\'s unconventional style and revolutionary sound. Later, Bitches Brew gained recognition as one of jazz\'s greatest albums and a progenitor of the jazz rock genre, as well as a major influence on rock and funk musicians. The album won a Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album in 1971. In 1998, Columbia Records released The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions, a four-disc box set that included the original album as well as the studio sessions through February 1970.\n\nRecording sessions took place at Columbia\'s 30th Street Studio over the course of three days in August 1969. Davis called the musicians to the recording studio on very short notice. A few pieces on Bitches Brew were rehearsed before the recording sessions, but at other times the musicians had little or no idea what they were to record. Once in the recording studio, the players were typically given only a few instructions: a tempo count, a few chords or a hint of melody, and suggestions as to mood or tone. Davis liked to work this way; he thought it forced musicians to pay close attention to one another, to their own performances, or to Davis\'s cues, which could change at any moment. On the quieter moments of "Bitches Brew", for example, Davis\'s voice is audible, giving instructions to the musicians: snapping his fingers to indicate tempo, or, in his distinctive whisper, saying, "Keep it tight" or telling individuals when to solo.\n\nDavis composed most of the music on the album. The two important exceptions were the complex "Pharaoh\'s Dance" (composed by Joe Zawinul) and the ballad "Sanctuary" (composed by Wayne Shorter). The latter had been recorded as a fairly straightforward ballad early in 1968, but was given a radically different interpretation on Bitches Brew. It begins with Davis and Chick Corea improvising on the standard "I Fall in Love too Easily" before Davis plays the "Sanctuary" theme. Then, not unlike Davis\'s recording of Shorter\'s "Nefertiti" two years earlier, the horns repeat the melody over and over while the rhythm section builds up the intensity. The issued "Sanctuary" is actually two consecutive takes of the piece. Despite his reputation as a "cool", melodic improviser, much of Davis\'s playing on this album is aggressive and explosive, often playing fast runs and venturing into the upper register of the trumpet. His closing solo on "Miles Runs the Voodoo Down" is particularly noteworthy in this regard. Davis did not perform on the short piece "John McLaughlin".\n\nThere was significant editing done to the recorded music. Short sections were spliced together to create longer pieces, and various effects were applied to the recordings. Enrico Merlin reports:\n\n    Bitches Brew also pioneered the application of the studio as a musical instrument, featuring stacks of edits and studio effects that were an integral part of the music. Miles and his producer, Teo Macero, used the recording studio in radical new ways, especially in the title track and the opening track, "Pharaoh\'s Dance". There were many special effects, like tape loops, tape delays, reverb chambers and echo effects. Through intensive tape editing, Macero concocted many totally new musical structures that were later imitated by the band in live concerts. Macero, who has a classical education and was most likely inspired by the 1930s and 1940s musique concrète experiments, used tape editing as a form of arranging and composition.\n\n    "Pharaoh\'s Dance" contains 19 edits – its famous stop-start opening is entirely constructed in the studio, using repeat loops of certain sections. Later on in the track there are several micro-edits: for example, a one-second-long fragment that first appears at 8:39 is repeated five times between 8:54 and 8:59. The title track contains 15 edits, again with several short tape loops of, in this case, five seconds (at 3:01, 3:07 and 3:12). Therefore, Bitches Brew not only became a controversial classic of musical innovation, it also became renowned for its pioneering use of studio technology.\n\n///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\nMiles Davis trumpet\nWayne Shorter ss, Bennie Maupin bcl, Joe Zawinul p\nLarry Young p, Chick Corea p, John McLaughlin g, \nDave Holland b, Harvey Brooks electric bass\nLenny White d, Jack DeJohnette d, Don Alias drums, congas\nJuma Santos shaker, congas\n\nMati Klarwein\'s painting on the cover \nReleased April 1970 - Recorded August 19-21.8. 1969\nProducer Teo Macero, Columbia  <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Bitches+Brew">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Despite the tensions within the band, Abbey Road was released to near universal acclaim and is considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2012, Abbey Road was voted 14th on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". In 2009, readers of the magazine also named Abbey Road the greatest Beatles album. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Abbey+Road">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth album by British rock band The Beatles. It was recorded with breaks from the end of 1966 to the middle of 1967 and published on June 14, 1967. The producer was George Martin, and the studio engineer was Geoff Emerick. Most critics agree with the choice of "Rolling Stone" magazine, according to which this is the greatest rock album of all time. This album also has the most famous cover in rock history.\n\nReleased on 26 May 1967, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the Record Retailer chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the United States. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in songwriting, production, and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. Its release was a defining moment in 1960s pop culture, heralding the Summer of Love, while the album\'s reception achieved full cultural legitimation for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form.\n\nAt the end of August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired by the Beatles\' youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "Penny Lane" were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP.\n\nThe album was loosely conceptualized as a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was conceived after recording the title track. A key work of British psychedelia, it incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. The band continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, the group colored much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds", "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" and "A Day in the Life". The recording was completed on 21 April. The pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth designed the cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures.\n\nMusicologists regard Sgt. Pepper was an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular music. The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones of the era\'s youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. It is considered one of the first art rock LPs, a progenitor to progressive rock, and the start of the album era. In 1968, it won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honor; in 2003, the Library of Congress inducted it into the National Recording Registry. It has topped several critics\' and listeners\' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by Rolling Stone magazine and in the book All-Time Top 1000 Albums, and the UK\'s "Music of the Millennium" poll. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time and the UK\'s best-selling studio album, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011.\n\nThe beginning of the psychedelic era:\nAfter giving up the rock tour in August 1966, the Beatles\' popularity began to decline sharply, and the media began to speculate that the band had "dried up" under the onslaught of a new generation of rock artists, primarily genre-oriented psychedelic rock. A type of rock and roll that is produced under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, primarily LSD.\n\nThe Beatles have used these drugs before, but their impact on their music has not been overly pronounced (except for a few songs from the Revolver album, including the group\'s first psychedelic song, Tomorrow Never Knows). In February 1967, at the urging of manager Brian Epstein, the Beatles released the single Strawberry Fields Forever / Penny Lane, with songs originally planned for their next LP album. The single took second place on the charts and after several years; it was characterized as a failure. However, after this, the group did not leave the studio for several months.\n\nStudy work:\nWith the permission of producer George Martin to use certain amounts of drugs in the studio, the Beatles were led by Paul McCartney for the first time, because the former frontman, John Lennon, was depressed due to family problems. McCartney was the author of most of the songs on the album (including the title songs), however, Lennon also significantly contributed to this project with songs such as Being for Benefits of Mr. Kite and A Day in the Life, part of which was recorded by McCartney for his own song, but Martin added it to Lennon. All the songs of these two were later, by an earlier agreement, marked traditionally - Lennon / McCartney, but each author is the lead vocalist in his song, except in the case of the song "With a Little Help of My Friends", sung by the drummer, Ringo Starr. As for the studio technique, the previous 4-channel recording machine, ADT (Auto Double-Tracking) machine for doubling one\'s voice was used. In the coming period, this machine will be more and more popular, as the individuality of the members grows in the group, who will want to record most or even their entire songs on their own.\n\nCover:\nAccording to various sources, the cover was also McCartney\'s idea. The Beatles, in guard uniforms, with wind instruments, for the first time with a mustache and beard, are an integral part of all versions of this album. However, in the American edition, that is where it all ends, because there is only a yellow wall behind the group. In the British (European) edition, behind the "Beatles" there is a bunch of people, important in the then and past time - among them are Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Marilyn Monroe, ... However, the "Beatles" themselves with the look of before this album. Also, below the members of the group is a floral decor with the inscription "The Beatles". An album like this was a lure for many conspiracy theorists, so this is also one of the most mysterious covers of all time.\n\nThe final concept:\nThe whole album is connected by one theme, which was a kind of precedent and thus the "Beatles" became the creators of the so-called "Concept album". The protagonist of the story in question is a certain Billy Shears (when, thanks to the fact that he lent his voice in the song "With a Little Help of My Friends", interpreted by Ringo Starr), who modestly announces a performance after the pompous performance of the Sergeant Pepper Club more "lonely hearts", claiming that "a little help from a friend" is enough for him after a hard day. Then, in the following songs, the Beatles comment on various existential problems - from a normal working day ("Good Morning, Good Morning"), old age ("When I\'m 64") to death itself and the problems around it ("Lucy in the Sky With Diamond ”, whose initial letters of the word, by the way, give the name of the drug LSD). The album closes with a slightly modified ("reprise") version of the first song, which builds on the last, "bis" song - "A Day in the Life". The whole album is accompanied by studio applause from the audience and applause.\n\nAfter publication\nThe album was a great success and many still consider it the most successful LP of the group. He received positive criticism even from critics of classical music when Lennon and McCartney were compared to Shostakovich and proclaimed the greatest composers in the period after Beethoven. The group vowed not to use narcotics anymore, as it found its new inner peace in a new spiritual, Indian leader, Maharishi-Mash Yogi, who is the creator of transcendental meditation. It is certain, however, that all members continued to use drugs. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Sgt.+Pepper%27s+Lonely+Hearts+Club+Band">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'In the Aeroplane Over the Sea is the second and final studio album by the American indie rock band Neutral Milk Hotel. It was released in the United States on February 10, 1998 on Merge Records and May 1998 on Blue Rose Records in the United Kingdom.\n\nJeff Mangum moved from Athens, Georgia to Denver, Colorado to prepare the bulk of the album\'s material with producer Robert Schneider, this time at Schneider\'s newly created Pet Sounds Studio at the home of Jim McIntyre.\n\nThe album was the sixth-best-selling vinyl album in 2008. NME named it the 98th greatest album of all time.\n\nIn the Aeroplane Over the Sea is widely considered to be written about Anne Frank due to lyrics seemingly referring to her, such as lines referring to her birth and death dates. Though the group has never officially stated that the album is indeed about Frank, it is a popular theory among fans, and Jeff Mangum has mentioned the influence her diary, The Diary of a Young Girl, has made on his craft and outright referred to "Holland, 1945" being about her while performing live. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Neutral+Milk+Hotel/In+the+Aeroplane+Over+the+Sea">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? is the eighth album from indie pop band of Montreal. It was released January 23, 2007. The album was written, performed, and recorded by Kevin Barnes, with assistance from friends and family: prominent Elephant Six members Bryan Poole, Jamey Huggins and Heather McIntosh, as well as Barnes\' wife Nina Twin, and daughter Alabee Blonde. Credits also feature Georgie Fruit, a glam rock alter-ego of Barnes.\n\nBarnes has described the album as a concept album, detailing his transformation from Kevin Barnes into Georgie Fruit. The transformation takes place during "The Past Is a Grotesque Animal," the 12-minute long "turning point" of the album. In addition, the album namechecks many things commonly associated with glam rock, such as drugs, art and fashion; "The Past Is a Grotesque Animal" alludes to Edward Albee\'s play Who\'s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and specifically mentions Georges Bataille\'s novel Histoire de l\'oeil.\n\nBarnes credits his being prescribed antidepressants with the making of the album. "The real issue was a chemical thing, so when I finally got on medication, that balanced it out. So that helped me have a better perspective on things and helped my relationship with my wife and helped me through the album." "Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse", the album\'s first single, chronicles his struggle with chemical imbalance and mood disorders. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/of+Montreal/Hissing+Fauna,+Are+You+the+Destroyer%3F">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'Animals is an album by English progressive rock band Pink Floyd, released on 23 January 1977 in the UK and on 2 February 1977 in the U.S.\n\nAnimals is a concept album, based on the flaws of capitalism. Various castes in society are represented as different types of animals (Dogs as the businessmen, sheep as the powerless pawns, and pigs as the ruthless leaders). Although this album mainly attacks capitalism, several components are similar to George Orwell\'s novel "Animal Farm": In the book various animals (mainly pigs, sheep, dogs, etc.) represent different roles assumed by individuals in a communist society.\n\nWhile singer and guitarist David Gilmour is only credited for the music of one track, the epic "Dogs" (previously known as "You Gotta Be Crazy"), this song and "Raving and Drooling", a Waters song which would later become "Sheep", were created at the same time as "Shine On You Crazy Diamond", and originally destined for Wish You Were Here. Their creation process was similar to the method the band used during the late sixties and early seventies. They would adapt and expand their compositions by performing them live, and later in the studio find a more coherent form and concept for the whole album, with Waters writing the lyrics. Animals was the last Pink Floyd album created in this way, as the subsequent The Wall and The Final Cut, were primarily conceived by Waters and worked out in the studio with some input from Gilmour. Although Rick Wright admittedly did not contribute much compositionally, he had some influence on the arrangement of the songs, including solo playing on "Dogs" and "Sheep". As with "Welcome to the Machine" and "Wish You Were Here" on Wish You Were Here, Waters wrote "Pigs on the Wing" and "Pigs (Three Different Ones)" to tie together the other songs in the album\'s concept. His dominance in the writing credits and the discrepancy with the actual creation process is directly related to the increasing tensions within the band.[citation needed].\n\nThe three core songs are bookended by a pair of love songs written by Waters for his then-wife Caroline:[citation needed] "Pigs on the Wing, Part 1" and "Pigs on the Wing, Part 2". Both are in stark contrast to the misanthropic middle three songs, and suggest that companionship can help us overcome our flaws – though the final lines suggest that the singer is or was once one of the dogs. For the 8-track cartridge release, which looped, Parts 1 and 2 were linked by a guitar bridge performed by Snowy White (subsequently available on White\'s 1996 album "Goldtop: Groups & Sessions"), and the 17:08 song "Dogs" was cut into two tracks.\n\nThe giant, helium-filled pig seen on the cover was actually flown over Battersea Power Station for the photo shoot (under the direction of Storm Thorgerson). On the first day of shooting, a marksman was on hand in case the pig broke free. However, according to Thorgerson, this was considered an "insurance problem", and he was not hired for the second day of shooting. Ironically, on December 3, 1976, during the second day, a gust of wind broke the pig free of its moorings. Because there was no one to shoot the pig down, it sailed away into the morning sky. A passenger plane reported seeing the pig, causing all the flights at London Heathrow Airport to be delayed[citation needed]. A police helicopter was sent up to track the pig, but was forced to return after following the pig to an altitude of 5,000 feet. A warning was sent out to pilots that a giant, flying pink pig was loose in the area[citation needed]. The CAA lost radar contact on the pig near Chatham in Kent, at a height of 18,000 feet and flying East. It finally landed in a farmer\'s field, without much damage. They then repaired the pig, and flew it up for a third time. The resulting pictures were not deemed suitable on their own (as the clear, blue sky from day three was thought to be much less evocative), and the final image was made as a composite of the power station picture from day one and the pig from day three.\n\nThe album had custom picture labels, using drummer Nick Mason\'s handwriting as a typeface, as did the lyrics on the liner sleeve. Side one\'s label depicted a fish-eye lens view of a dog and the English countryside. Side two\'s was similar, but featured a pig and sheep instead of the dog.\n\nOriginally released on Columbia Records in the U.S. and Harvest Records in the UK, Animals was then remastered in 1992 for its inclusion on the Shine On box set. The remaster was subsequently released on its own by EMI in 1994. In 1997, Columbia Records issued an updated remaster in the United States, Canada, Australia, South America and Japan. Animals was again re-released in April 2000 by Capitol Records in the US, and on the EMI label in Japan, Canada, South America and Australia again using the 1992 Shine On remaster along with the artwork from the 1994 EMI Europe reissue.\n\nThe album proved a success in the United Kingdom, where it reached #2 in the era of punk music. It was also a success in the U.S., reaching #3 on the Billboard album charts (#1 and #2 were Hotel California by The Eagles, and the soundtrack to the Barbara Streisand film A Star Is Born). However, it was on the American charts for only six months even though it has continued to sell solidly, to the extent of its having gone quadruple platinum, according to the RIAA.\n\nIn the UK, the British Phonographic Industry awarded the album Gold (100,000 units) in 1977. It has yet to achieve Platinum.\n\n <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Animals">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

            'The band entered Abbey Road Studios during the first week of 1975 to begin recording on their follow-up to Dark Side of the Moon. In the previous year, they introduced three new pieces to European audiences during the first sets of each show. Two of them, "Raving and Drooling" & "You Gotta Be Crazy", were ultimately not recorded for Wish You Were Here, but re-shaped and recorded in 1976 for the Animals album as respectively "Sheep" and "Dogs". \n\nThe third would take shape as the album\'s centerpiece, "Shine on You Crazy Diamond". During tour rehearsals for the previous year\'s French summer tour, David Gilmour came up with the signature 4-note theme and the piece took shape from there. With the memory of former front-man/singer-songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett fresh in his mind, Roger Waters wrote the lyrics as a tribute to his fallen friend, at the time already an reclusive figure.\n\nIn 1974, it would be performed as one uninterrupted piece. However, during the band\'s tour of North America the following year, it would be split in two parts, sandwiching another new song, "Have a Cigar". A funky guitar-driven piece, it would ultimately be sung on the final recorded version by Roy Harper, as Roger\'s voice was in poor shape. This song, and the ominous "Welcome to the Machine" were written reflecting the band\'s negative attitude towards the record industry. They also (with various instrumental parts of "Shine On") feature synthesizers in a stronger fashion than previous albums, as well as the sound effects (provided by Nick Mason) that are signature to the Floyd sound.\n\nThe title track took shape when Gilmour came to the studio and showed the band the chord sequence, which suitably impressed Waters. He then wrote the lyrics, referring to Syd Barrett\'s departure and Roger\'s own growing alienation from his band and from other people (these themes later on would become essential to his story of The Wall). More than any previous Floyd number, it has a very prominent Country & Western feel to the instrumentation (pedal steel guitar and acoustic piano) and the melancholy feel to the lyrics. It would eventually become one of the band\'s signature songs, and is as of now (May of 2009) the band\'s most scrobbled song on Last.fm.\n\nTowards the end of the recording process, a stranger who at first looked unfamiliar to the band and the engineers appeared in the studio. After much discussion of who it was, the band slowly recognized him as the man whose story and personal relationship with the group had heavily influenced the record, Syd Barrett. Each member was unsure of what song they were mixing, but urban legend has it that it was "Shine On", which adds a new and deep personal resonance to the already emotional piece. Subsequently Syd disappeared from sight, as the band members attended David Gilmour\'s wedding ceremony that night. That was the last time any member of Pink Floyd had personal contact with their former enigmatic leader.\n\nThe record was released in the Fall of 1975, the band\'s first on Columbia Records (in the United States, EMI was and remained the Floyd\'s International label). It became the fastest selling record of their career, topping both the American (certified Gold within two days of it\'s release and ultimately 6X Multi-Platinum in May 1997 by the R.I.A.A.) and U.K. album charts (Gold within the year, but has yet to achieve Platinum status).\n\nThe band themselves hold the album in high artistic regard, despite the negative and disconnected environment during recording, with both Gilmour and Rick Wright saying it was their favorite. It was the last of their albums in which Rick played an important role in composing the music (making significant keyboard contributions on "Shine On"), until nearly 20 years later with The Division Bell. On the band\'s next three albums, the lions share of the song-writing credit would go to Roger Waters. This, in part with the deteriorating relationship between the band, would cause Roger to leave in 1985, ten years after Wish You Were Here.\n\nTracklist\n1.

            'Daydream Nation is the fifth studio album by the American alternative rock band Sonic Youth. It was released in October 1988 by Enigma in the United States, and by Blast First in the United Kingdom. A number of publications, including Rolling Stone, Spin Magazine, and Pitchfork Media have hailed it as one of the best albums of the 1980s. As a result, it is regarded as a milestone of 1980s underground music.\n\nAlthough arguably the two albums immediately before it—Evol and Sister—mark Sonic Youth\'s first attempts at shifting from their roots in unsettling noise-rock to a somewhat more accessible combination of avant guitar experimentation and traditional rock, for many listeners, Daydream Nation is the apex where this change fully took hold. The album cover itself invokes this transition, with the 1983 Gerhard Richter photorealist painting Kerze ("Candle"). The back cover art is a similar Richter painting from 1982.\n\nNevertheless, initial sales were poor, partly because Enigma Records, Sonic Youth\'s American record label, went out of business not long after the record\'s release. After a period of being out of print, Daydream Nation was reissued by DGC in 1993, which had signed the band largely on the strength of the crossover critical acclaim reaped by the album. In 1988, the single "Teen Age Riot", charted on Billboard Magazine\'s newly created Modern Rock Tracks chart at #20.\n\nIn 2007, Sonic Youth undertook a series of performances of the album in its entirety.\n\nOn June 12, 2007, a two-CD deluxe edition of the album was released. It contains live versions of every track on the album, plus studio recordings of some cover songs. A 4-LP vinyl version was released on July 17, 2007.\n\nThis is Deluxe Edition and it should be called Daydream Nation (Deluxe Edition) , original release has only 12 tracks  <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Sonic+Youth/Daydream+Nation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
