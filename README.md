# Topsters

Inspired by the social media trend of sharing your favoirte albums/artists in collage form. 

I wanted to create a user-friendly music-based web application that stored collections of albums that I enjoyed and I think this project achieves that spectacularly. This project also includes some premade topsters of popular music establishments and critics that the user may find interesting. Further, I also plan on creating a version that integrates a spotify music player so the user can enjoy any particular collection of music without having to tediously look up each album individually in order to taste test it.
