It initially met with a lukewarm critical and commercial response in the United States, peaking at number 10 in the Billboard 200, a significantly lower placement than the band\'s preceding albums. In the United Kingdom, the album was hailed by its music press and was an immediate commercial success, peaking at number 2 in the UK Top 40 Albums Chart and remaining among the top ten positions for six months. Pet Sounds has subsequently gathered worldwide acclaim from critics and musicians alike, and is widely considered to be one of the most influential albums in music history.\n\nThe album was produced and arranged by Brian Wilson, who also wrote and composed almost all of its music. Most of the recording sessions were conducted between January and April 1966, a year after he had quit touring with the Beach Boys in order to focus more attention on writing and recording. For Pet Sounds, Wilson\'s goal was to create "the greatest rock album ever made" \u2014 a personalised work with no filler tracks. It is sometimes considered a Wilson solo album, repeating the themes and ideas he had introduced with The Beach Boys Today! one year earlier. The album\'s lead single, "Caroline, No", was issued as his official solo debut. It was followed by two singles credited to the group: "Wouldn\'t It Be Nice" (backed with "God Only Knows") and "Sloop John B".\n\nCollaborating with lyricist Tony Asher, Wilson\'s symphonic arrangements wove elaborate layers of vocal harmonies, coupled with sound effects and unusual instruments such as bicycle bells, buzzing organs, harpsichords, flutes, Electro-Theremin, trains, Hawaiian-sounding string instruments, Coca-Cola cans, and barking dogs, along with the more usual keyboards and guitars. Unified by Wall of Sound-style production techniques, the album comprised Wilson\'s "pet sounds", consisting mainly of introspective songs like "You Still Believe in Me", about faithfulness, "I Know There\'s an Answer", a critique of LSD users, and "I Just Wasn\'t Made for These Times", an autobiographical statement on social alienation (as well as the first use of a theremin-like instrument on a rock record). Recording was completed on April 13, 1966, with an unprecedented total production cost that exceeded $70,000 (equivalent to $520,000 in 2016). A follow-up album, Smile, was immediately planned, but left unfinished. In 1997, a "making-of" version of Pet Sounds was supervised by Wilson and released as The Pet Sounds Sessions, containing the album\'s first true stereo mix.\n\nPet Sounds is regarded by musicologists as an early concept album that advanced the field of music production, introducing non-standard harmonies and timbres, and incorporating elements of pop, jazz, exotica, classical, and the avant-garde. A heralding work of psychedelia, the album furthered an aesthetic trend within rock by helping it transform from dance music into music that was made for listening to, elevating itself to the level of art rock. Author Bill Martin said that Pet Sounds represents a turning point where the Beach Boys "brought expansions in harmony, instrumentation (and therefore timbre), duration, rhythm, and the use of recording technology. Of these elements, the first and last were the most important in clearing a pathway toward the development of progressive rock." In 2004, Pet Sounds was preserved in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant." One year earlier, Rolling Stone ranked it second on its list of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time". As of 2015, Acclaimed Music lists Pet Sounds as the statistically most acclaimed album of all time. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Pet+Sounds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The opening "Love\'s in Need of Love Today" and "Have a Talk with God" are curiously subdued, but Stevie soon kicks into gear with "Village Ghetto Land," a fierce expos\xe9 of ghetto neglect set to a satirical Baroque synthesizer. Hot on its heels comes the torrid fusion jam "Contusion," a big, brassy hit tribute to the recently departed Duke Ellington in "Sir Duke," and (another hit, this one a Grammy winner as well) the bumping poem to his childhood, "I Wish." Though they didn\'t necessarily appear in order, Songs in the Key of Life contains nearly a full album on love and relationships, along with another full album on issues social and spiritual. Fans of the love album Talking Book can marvel that he sets the bar even higher here, with brilliant material like the tenderly cathartic and gloriously redemptive "Joy Inside My Tears," the two-part, smooth-and-rough "Ordinary Pain," the bitterly ironic "All Day Sucker," or another classic heartbreaker, "Summer Soft." Those inclined toward Stevie Wonder the social-issues artist had quite a few songs to focus on as well: "Black Man" was a Bicentennial school lesson on remembering the vastly different people who helped build America; "Pastime Paradise" examined the plight of those who live in the past and have little hope for the future; "Village Ghetto Land" brought listeners to a nightmare of urban wasteland; and "Saturn" found Stevie questioning his kinship with the rest of humanity and amusingly imagining paradise as a residency on a distant planet. If all this sounds overwhelming, it is; Stevie Wonder had talent to spare during the mid-\'70s, and instead of letting the reserve trickle out during the rest of the decade, he let it all go with one massive burst. (His only subsequent record of the \'70s was the similarly gargantuan but largely instrumental soundtrack Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants.)\n\nSongs In The Key Of Life eventually went on to be certified diamond. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Stevie+Wonder/Songs+in+the+Key+of+Life">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind was the group\'s first release on Geffen Records, which signaled its move away from Seattle-based independent record label Sub Pop. Front man Kurt Cobain sought to make music outside of the restrictive confines of the Seattle grunge scene, drawing influence from groups such as the Pixies and its use of loud/quiet song dynamics.\n\nNevermind was a surprise success by late 1991, largely due to the success of its lead single "Smells Like Teen Spirit". By January 1992 it had replaced Michael Jackson\'s album Dangerous at number one on the Billboard charts. Nevermind was responsible for bringing alternative rock to a large mainstream audience, and would subsequently be regarded as one of the best rock albums of all time.\n\nNirvana was a band from Aberdeen, Washington, formed by Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic, that had signed to Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. The group released its debut album Bleach in 1989, with Chad Channing on drums. However, Channing left Nirvana in 1990, and the band was in need of a permanent drummer. Upon seeing a show by hardcore punk band Scream, the group\'s drummer, Dave Grohl, impressed Novoselic and Cobain. When Scream unexpectedly disbanded, Grohl contacted Novoselic, made his way to Seattle, and was soon invited to join the band. Novoselic said in retrospect that when Grohl joined the band, everything "fell into place".\n\nMeanwhile Cobain was writing a number of new songs. At the time Cobain was listening to bands like R.E.M., The Smithereens, and the Pixies. Feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the Seattle grunge scene which Sub Pop had built its image upon, Cobain\u2014inspired by his contemporary listening habits\u2014began writing songs that were more melodic. A key development was the single "Sliver", released on Sub Pop in 1990 (before Grohl joined the band), which Cobain said "was like a statement in a way. I had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record. I wanted to write more songs like that." Grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening their music to children\'s music, in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as possible.\n\nBy the start of the 1990s, Sub Pop was experiencing financial difficulties. With rumors that Sub Pop would sign up as a subsidiary for a major label, the band decided to "cut out the middleman" and start to look for a major label. A number of labels courted the band, but Nirvana ultimately signed with Geffen Records imprint DGC Records based upon the recommendation of its management, who also managed the band\'s idols (and recent Geffen signings) Sonic Youth, and Sonic Youth\'s Kim Gordon.\n\nIn the spring of 1990, Nirvana began planning its second album for Sub Pop, tentatively titled Sheep. For the album, Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt suggested Butch Vig as a potential producer. Nirvana particularly liked Vig\'s work with Killdozer and called Vig up to tell him, "We want to sound as heavy as that record." In April 1990, the band traveled out to Vig\'s Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to begin work on the album. Most of the basic song arrangements were completed by that time, but Cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record. Ultimately, eight songs were recorded: "Immodium" (later renamed "Breed"), "Dive" (later released as the B-side to "Sliver"), "In Bloom", "Pay to Play" (eventually renamed "Stay Away" and given a new set of lyrics), "Sappy", "Lithium", "Here She Comes Now" (released on Velvet Underground Tribute Album: Heaven and Hell Volume 1), and "Polly". The band had planned to record more tracks, but Cobain blew his voice out on "Lithium", forcing them to shut down recording. Vig was told that the band would come back to record more songs, but the producer did not hear anything for a while. Instead, the band used the sessions as a demo tape to shop for a new label. Within a few months, the tape was circulating amongst major labels, creating a buzz around the group.\n\nAfter signing to Geffen, a number of producers for the album were suggested, including Scott Litt, David Briggs, and Don Dixon, but Nirvana held out for Vig. Novoselic noted in 2001 that the band was already nervous about recording on a major label, since the producers suggested wanted percentage points for the album, and they optioned for Vig, with whom they felt comfortable collaborating. Afforded a budget of $65,000, Nirvana recorded Nevermind at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, California in May and June 1991. Nirvana was originally set to record the album during March and April 1991, but the date kept getting pushed back in spite of the band\'s anxiousness to begin the sessions. To pay gas money to get to Los Angeles, Nirvana played a show where they played "Smells Like Teen Spirit" for the first time. The band sent Vig some rehearsal tapes prior to the sessions that featured songs recorded previously at Smart Studios, along with some new ones including "Smells Like Teen Spirit" and "Come as You Are".\n\nWhen the group arrived in California, Nirvana did a few days of pre-production where the band and Vig tightened up some of the song arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart Studios sessions was the song "Polly", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes; if the takes weren\'t satisfactory at that point, they would move on to something else. The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain\'s phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on the song "In Bloom" by telling him "John Lennon did it." While the sessions went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: "He\'d be great for an hour, and then he\'d sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour."\n\nAfter the recording sessions were completed, Vig and the band set out to mix the album. However, after a few days, both Vig and the band members realized that they were unhappy with how the mixes were turning out. As a result, they decided to call in someone else to oversee the mixing, with Geffen Records imprint DGC supplying a list of possible options. The list contained several familiar names, including Scott Litt (known for his work with R.E.M.) and Ed Stasium (known for his work with The Smithereens). However, Cobain feared that bringing in known mixers would result in the album sounding like the work of those bands. Instead, Cobain chose Andy Wallace (who had co-produced Slayer\'s 1990 album Seasons in the Abyss) from the bottom of the list. Novoselic recalled, "We said, \'right on,\' because those Slayer records were so heavy." Wallace ran the songs through various special effects boxes and tweaked the drum sounds, completing about one mix per day. Both Wallace and Vig noted years later that upon hearing Wallace\'s work the band loved the mixes. After the album\'s release members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given Nevermind. Cobain said in Come as You Are, "Looking back on the production of Nevermind, I\'m embarrassed by it now. It\'s closer to a M\xf6tley Cr\xfce record than it is a punk rock record."\n\nNevermind was mastered on the afternoon of August 2 in The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called "Endless, Nameless" intended to appear at the end of "Something in the Way", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, "In the beginning, it was kind of a verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so you can call it my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn\'t write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn\'t on there." When the band discovered the song\'s omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of "Something in the Way" and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.\n\nNevermind was released on September 24, 1991. American record stores received an initial shipment of 46,251 copies, while 35,000 copies were shipped in the United Kingdom, where Bleach had been successful. The lead single "Smells Like Teen Spirit" had been released on September 10 with the intention of being a base-building cut among alternative rock fans, while the next single "Come As You Are" would be the song that would possibly garner more attention. The band set out on a short American tour four days before the release date to support the album. Geffen Records hoped that Nevermind would sell around 250,000 copies, which was the same level the record company had achieved with Sonic Youth\'s Geffen debut Goo. The best estimate was that if all involved worked hard, the record could possibly be certified Gold by September 1992.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 at position 144, which was high enough for the album to top the Heatseekers chart as well. Geffen shipped about half of the initial US pressing to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song\'s video had received a world premiere on MTV\'s late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, "Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind of neat. But I don\'t give a shit about some kind of achievement like that. It\'s cool\u2014I guess."\n\nAs the band set out for their European tour at the start of November 1991, Nevermind entered the Billboard Top 40 for the first time at number 35. By this point, "Smells Like Teen Spirit" had become a genuine hit and the album was selling so fast none of Geffen\'s marketing strategies aimed at different sales levels could be enacted. Geffen president Ed Rosenblatt told The New York Times, "We didn\'t do anything. It was just one of those \'Get out of the way and duck\' records." Nirvana found as they toured Europe during the end of 1991 that the shows were dangerously oversold, television crews became a constant presence onstage, and "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was almost omnipresent on radio and music television.\n\nNevermind became Nirvana\'s first number one album on January 11, 1992, replacing Michael Jackson at the top of the Billboard charts. By this time, Nevermind was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. "Come As You Are" was finally released as the second single in March 1992; it peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Two more singles, "Lithium" and "In Bloom", were released from the album.\n\nNevermind was certified Gold and Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in November 1991, and was certified Diamond in March 1999. It was also certified Diamond in Canada (1,000,000 units) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association in March 2001. In 1996, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released Nevermind on vinyl as part of its ANADISQ 200 series, and as a 24-carat gold CD. The CD pressings included "Endless, Nameless". The LP version sold out quickly of its limited pressing, but the CD edition stayed in print.\n\nUpon the album\'s release, several mainstream newspapers and magazines gave Nevermind positive reviews. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, "With \'Nevermind,\' Nirvana has certainly succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment." Schoemer concluded, "\'Nevermind\' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered." Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A\u2013 rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind Nirvana "never entertain the notion" of wanting to sound "normal," compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that "When Nirvana released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us figured they had the potential to make an album that would blow every other contender away. My God have they proved us right."\n\nRolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars; reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, "If Nirvana isn\'t onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio\'s high-octane hits." The Boston Globe was less enthusiastic about the album; reviewer Steve Morse wrote, "Most of Nevermind is packed with generic punk-pop that had been done by countless acts from Iggy Pop to the Red Hot Chili Peppers," and added "the band has little or nothing to say, settling for moronic ramblings by singer-lyricist Cobain."\n\nNevermind was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics\' poll; "Smells Like Teen Spirit" also topped the single of the year and video of the year polls. Nevermind topped the poll by a large majority, and Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote in his companion piece to the poll, "As a modest pop surprise they might have scored a modest victory, like De La Soul in 1990. Instead, their multi-platinum takeover constituted the first full-scale public validation of the Amerindie values\u2014the noise, the toons, the \'tude\u2014the radder half of the Pazz & Jop poll electorate came up on."\n\nCobain, Nirvana\'s main songwriter, fashioned chord sequences that were based mainly around power chords and wrote songs that combined pop hooks with dissonant guitar rhythms. His aim for Nevermind\'s material was to sound like the "Bay City Rollers getting molested by Black Flag". Many of the songs on Nevermind feature shifts in dynamics, where the band changes from quiet verses to loud choruses. Dave Grohl said this approach originated during a four-month period prior to the recording of the album, where the band would experiment with extreme dynamics during regular jam sessions.\n\nGuitar World wrote, "Kurt Cobain\'s guitar sound on Nirvana\'s Nevermind set the tone for Nineties rock music." On Nevermind, Cobain played a 1960s Fender Mustang, a Fender Jaguar with DiMarzio pickups, and a few Fender Stratocasters with humbucker bridge pickups. The guitarist used distortion and chorus pedals as his main effects, the latter used to generate a "watery" sound on "Come as You Are" and the pre-choruses of "Smells Like Teen Spirit". Krist Novoselic tuned down his bass guitar one and a half steps to D flat "to get this fat-ass sound".\n\nGrohl said that Cobain told him, "Music comes first, lyrics come second," and Grohl believes that above all Cobain focused on the melodies of his songs. Cobain was still working on the album\'s lyrics well into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally, Cobain\'s phrasing on the album is often difficult to understand. Vig asserted that clarity of Cobain\'s singing was not paramount. Vig said, "Even though you couldn\'t quite tell what he was singing about, you knew it was intense as hell." Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing "Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they\'ve transcribed them incorrectly?"\n\nCharles R. Cross asserted in his 2001 biography of Kurt Cobain, Heavier Than Heaven, that many of the songs written for Nevermind were about Cobain\'s dysfunctional relationship with Tobi Vail. After the relationship ended, Cobain began writing and painting violent scenes, many of which revealed hatred for himself and others. Songs written during this period were less violent, but still reflected anger absent from Cobain\'s earlier songs. Cross wrote "In the four months following their break-up, Kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs, all of them about Tobi Vail". "Drain You" begins with the line "One baby to another said \'I\'m lucky to have met you\'", quoting what Vail had once told Cobain, and the line "It is now my duty to completely drain you" refers to the power Vail had over Kurt in their relationship. According to Novoselic, "\'Lounge Act\' is about Tobi", and the song contains the line "I\'ll arrest myself, I\'ll wear a shield", referring to Cobain having the K Records logo tattooed on his arm to impress Vail. Though "Lithium" had been written before Cobain knew Vail, the lyrics of the song were changed to reference her. Cobain also said in an interview with Musician that "some of my very personal experiences, like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships, feeling that death void that the person in the song is feeling\u2013very lonely, sick."\n\nThe album\'s tentative title Sheep was something Cobain created as an inside joke towards the people he expected to buy the record. He wrote a fake ad for Sheep in his journal that read "Because you want to not; because everyone else is." Novoselic said the inspiration for the title was the band\'s cynicism about the public\'s reaction to Operation Desert Storm. As recording sessions for the album were completed, Cobain grew tired of the title and suggested to Novoselic that the new album be named Nevermind. Cobain liked the title because it was a metaphor for his attitude on life, and because it was grammatically incorrect.\n\nThe Nevermind album cover shows a baby swimming toward a US dollar bill on a fishhook. According to Cobain, he conceived the idea while watching a television program on water births with Grohl. Cobain mentioned it to Geffen\'s art director Robert Fisher. Fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company. Also, the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that they subsequently settled on wanted $7,500 a year for its use, so instead Fisher sent a photographer to a pool for babies to take pictures. Five shots resulted and the band settled on the image of a three-month-old infant named Spencer Elden, the son of the photographer\'s friend Rick Elden. However, there was some concern because Elden\'s penis was visible in the image. Geffen prepared an alternate cover without the penis, as they were afraid that it would offend people, but relented when Cobain made it clear that the only compromise he would accept was a sticker covering the penis that would say, "If you\'re offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile."\n\nThe back cover of the album features a photograph of a rubber monkey in front of a collage created by Cobain. The collage features photos of raw beef from a supermarket advertisement, images from Dante\'s Inferno, and pictures of diseased vaginas from Cobain\'s collection of medical photos. Cobain noted, "If you look real close, there is a picture of Kiss in the back standing on a slab of beef." The album\'s liner notes contain no complete song lyrics; instead, the liner contains random song lyrics and unused lyrical fragments that Cobain arranged into a poem.\n\nNevermind not only popularized the Seattle grunge movement, but also brought alternative rock as a whole into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Nevermind\'s success surprised Nirvana\'s contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi\'s Guy Picciotto later commented: "It was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had. It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that in the aftermath of the album\'s breakthrough, "Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock bands had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.\n\nMichael Azerrad argued in his Nirvana biography Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana (1993) that Nevermind marked the emergence of a generation of music fans in their twenties in a climate dominated by the musical tastes of the baby boomer generation that preceded them. Azerrad wrote, "Nevermind came along at exactly the right time. This was music by, for, and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked, ignored, or condescended to." Rolling Stone wrote in its entry for Nevermind on its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, "No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation\u2014a nation of teens suddenly turned punk\u2014and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator."\n\nNevermind has continued to garner critical praise since its release. The album was listed at number seventeen on Rolling Stone\'s list "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time". Time placed Nevermind, which writer Josh Tyrangiel called "the finest album of the 90s," on its 2006 list of "The All-TIME 100 Albums." Pitchfork named the album the sixth best of the decade, noting that "anyone who hates this record today is just trying to be cool, and needs to be trying harder." In 2005, the Library of Congress added Nevermind to the National Recording Registry, which collects "culturally, historically or aesthetically important" sound recordings from the 20th century. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Produced by Butch Vig, Nevermind was the group\'s first release on Geffen Records, which signaled its move away from Seattle-based independent record label Sub Pop. Front man Kurt Cobain sought to make music outside of the restrictive confines of the Seattle grunge scene, drawing influence from groups such as the Pixies and its use of loud/quiet song dynamics. Nevermind was a surprise success by late 1991, largely due to the success of its lead single "Smells Like Teen Spirit".

Largely recorded in California during 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut and was released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records. The record peaked at the top of both the main United States Billboard chart and the United Kingdom Albums Chart. \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Don't Stop\", \"Dreams\", and \"You Make Loving Fun\" were released as singles. A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release with sales of over 40 million copies worldwide, and diamond certifications in several countries, including the US, UK and Australia.\n\nThe band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences informed the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.\n\nRumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions.\n\nIn July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's tenth album was released to great commercial success, eventually selling over four million copies and reaching #1 in 1976. The record's hit single \"Rhiannon\" gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending nearly eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks\u2014who had joined the band before 1975's Fleetwood Mac and after guitarist Bob Welch had left were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother of his two children, had an affair with his best friend.\n\nPress intrusions into the band members' lives led to inaccurate stories. Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood's daughter Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer for a 10th anniversary tour. Despite false reports, the band did not change line-up, although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began. Fleetwood has noted the \"tremendous emotional sacrifices\" made by everyone just to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer, Keith Olsen, because he favoured a lower emphasis on the rhythm section. The duo formed a company called Seedy Management to represent the band's interests.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Rumours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the years following its release, it has come to be regarded as one of his very best albums \u2014 making it quite common for subsequent records to be labeled his "best since Blood on the Tracks." It is also commonly seen as a standard for confessional singer-songwriter albums; though Dylan has denied that the songs are autobiographical, his son Jakob Dylan has stated: "The songs are my parents talking." Most of the lyrics on the album revolve around heartache, anger, and loneliness. In 2003, the album was ranked number 16 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nThe album reached #1 on the Billboard U.S. pop charts and #4 in the UK. The single "Tangled Up in Blue" peaked at #31 on the Pop singles chart. The album remains one of Dylan\'s all-time best-selling studio releases, with a double-platinum US certification to date. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan/Blood+on+the+Tracks">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was considered to mark a change in the course for the band, with more traditional catchy melodies and accessible-sounding music (their previous album, 1997\'s Zaireeka, was a quadruple album of experimental sounds meant to be played on four separate stereo systems simultaneously) and lyrics that were more serious and thoughtful in content. The album was noted for its fusion of ordinary rock instruments, electronic beats and synthesizers. Its large, layered, symphonic sound has also earned it a reputation as the Pet Sounds of the 1990s from a few critics. The cover artwork of the album is a modified version of a photograph taken by Lawrence Schiller for a1966 Life magazine article on LSD. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Flaming+Lips/The+Soft+Bulletin">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Dec 2020, 09:56",content:'Fetch the Bolt Cutters is the fifth studio album by American singer-songwriter Fiona Apple. It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple\'s first release since The Idler Wheel... in 2012. The album was recorded from 2015 to 2020, largely at Apple\'s home in Venice Beach. It was produced and performed by Apple alongside Amy Aileen Wood, Sebastian Steinberg and Dav\xedd Garza; recording consisted of long, often-improvised takes with unconventional percussive sounds. GarageBand was used for much of this recording, and Apple credited the album\'s unedited vocals and long takes to her lack of expertise with the program.\n\nRooted in experimentation, the album largely features unconventional percussion. While conventional instruments, such as pianos and drum sets, do appear, the album also features prominent use of non-musical found objects as percussion. Apple described the result as "percussion orchestras". These industrial-like rhythms are contrasted against traditional melodies, and the upbeat songs often subvert traditional pop structures.\n\nThe album explores freedom from oppression; Apple identified its core message as: "Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\'re in". The title, a quote from TV series The Fall, reflects this idea. The album also discusses Apple\'s complex relationships with other women and other personal experiences, including bullying and sexual assault. It has nevertheless been referred to as Apple\'s most humorous album.\n\nFetch the Bolt Cutters was released during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many critics found its exploration of confinement timely. It received significant critical acclaim, and was described as an instant classic and Apple\'s best work to date. The album received a nomination for Best Alternative Music Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, whilst "Shameika" was nominated for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums, with 44,000 equivalent album units. It also charted in the top 15 in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2012, after releasing The Idler Wheel..., Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a concept album based on her home in Venice Beach or the Pando in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members Sebastian Steinberg, Amy Aileen Wood and Dav\xedd Garza. They began writing and rehearsing in Apple\'s Venice Beach home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.In July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the Sonic Ranch studio in rural Texas, where they recorded most of "Relay", "Ladies", "Cosmonauts" and "On I Go". Apple recalled that these sessions were often unproductive, with the band being distracted by magic mushrooms and films. They returned to Los Angeles, working on the material at Stanley Recordings. Apple decided that recording should relocate to her Venice Beach home studio, where they soon returned. She likened her house to "the womb of where I\'ve developed into an adult", so she chose to record the album at home to "repay" the house. She elaborated on the house\'s presence in the album: "I really felt like it\'s an instrument in itself, it\'s the microphone: The house is the microphone, the house is the ambiance, the house is a member of the band". Further sessions for "Newspaper" and "Heavy Balloon" took place at engineer Dave Way\'s private studio, Waystation.\n\nThey recorded long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects; her vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound. The sessions at Apple\'s home were largely recorded with GarageBand. On the long, unedited takes, Apple commented: "I didn\'t even know how to edit it and make a take shorter, so each track is just this one long take, and if I made a mistake in it, well, I better just play over it and let that mistake work itself into it". This resulted in what Apple described as "percussion orchestras", especially on "Newspaper" and the title track.\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album. At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with Vulture, explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released "a million years ago" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive responses brought Apple back on track. In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being "artwork and stuff". In March, she announced that she had finished recording.\n\nThe album\'s sound is defined by percussion. The piano-playing typical to Apple\'s work is still evident, but takes a more percussive form. As well as drum sets and traditional percussion, the album features the use of found objects as percussion, such as a metal butterfly and the bones of Apple\'s deceased dog Janet. The experimental rhythms on the album evoke industrial music and are juxtaposed against more traditional melodies. Stereogum\'s Tom Breihan argues that while percussive music is typically "built around the idea of dancing, of guiding and channeling the rhythms of the human body", the album instead "plays as a wild, feverish attempt to mirror the chaos that goes on in the human mind when it\'s at its most overheated". Apple has attributed the album\'s prominent use of percussion to a childhood habit, developed as a part of her obsessive-compulsive disorder, in which she would always walk rhythmically to a strict tempo.\n\nThe album has been noted for its experimental approach to pop music. Critics have noted its ambition and originality. Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of Joni Mitchell,Tom Waits, Nina Simone,and Kate Bush, who is quoted on the title track. The album often rejects popular music\'s traditional verse-chorus structure. The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple\'s past work, with the uptempo songs being described as "funny, angry, and at times triumphant".The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording.\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: "I have fun with my voice, but I\'m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\'m not trying to convince anybody I\'m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument". Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates "a rapper\'s sense that words can be music", while The Guardian\'s Laura Barton highlighted the intimacy of Apple\'s vocals: "half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp". Jon Pareles of The New York Times found that "whether she\'s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control".\n\nLyrically, Apple identified the album\'s main theme as "not being afraid to speak," with Barton similarly recognizing "a refusal to be silenced". Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that "it\'s about breaking out of whatever prison you\'ve allowed yourself to live in," and pinpointing the message as: "Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\'re in". She has said that writing the album helped free her of the ideas she had of herself, explaining that "this whole album, for me, has turned into the headache that I had inside of my head and now that it\'s released, it\'s like this pulse that now we can all share".  Pareles found that the album explored "both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles,  own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them". The album explores freedom, with Breihan writing that "we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening". The album has also been identified as Apple\'s most humorous album.\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.  Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,  and the album features Apple trying to make peace with "the sorts of women that society has always deemed her \'competition\'", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.  Apple summarized this idea as "not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message"\n\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive New Yorker profile. At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17. Epic Records had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the coronavirus pandemic. However, Apple pushed to release the album early, both for the benefit of listeners who were under self-isolation, and so she could avoid stressful press commitments. Apple\'s friend King Princess also encouraged the early release. Critics have commented on the timeliness of releasing the album during the pandemic, finding thematic relevance in its exploration of confinement, and comparing Apple\'s reclusiveness to the widespread self-isolation restrictions.\n\nNo singles were issued from the album prior to its release, but "Shameika" was released to adult alternative radio on April 27 as the album\'s lead single. On November 20, a music video was released for the track, directed by Matthias Brown. The video features the voice of Shameika Stepney, the song\'s namesake, who reunited with Apple following the album\'s release. On the same day, Stepney released "Shameika Said", featuring vocals from Apple and samples of "Shameika".\n\nOn the US Billboard 200, Fetch the Bolt Cutters debuted at number four with 44,000 equivalent album units, marking the singer\'s third consecutive top 10 album, and her second-highest charting release; The Idler Wheel... reached number three in 2012. Of that sum, 30,000 are in album sales, 13,000 are in SEA units and less than 1,000 are in TEA units. It also debuted atop the Billboard charts for Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums. Outside of the US, the album reached the top ten in Canada, the top 15 in Australia and New Zealand, the top 40 in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Scotland, Denmark, the UK and the Flanders region of Belgium, and the top 100 in Austria, Italy and France. Once the physical copies of the album were released in July, the album re-entered the Billboard 200 at number 60 with 6,500 sales. It also debuted at number one on the US Vinyl Album chart, making this her second consecutive album to achieve this.\n\nThe lead single "Shameika" peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart in June 2020; it was Apple\'s first entry on the chart since "Fast as You Can" in January 2000, breaking the record for the longest time between entries on the chart. The album\'s first five tracks all appeared on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart, as her first ever entries on the chart.\n\nPitchfork: 10/10\n\n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple/Fetch+the+Bolt+Cutters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

by the English rock band Radiohead, released in 1997. It reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart and marked Radiohead\'s highest entry into the American market at the time, where it debuted at #21. OK Computer expanded the band\'s worldwide popularity, becoming the last Radiohead album to have a delayed release outside of the United Kingdom. As of 2007, it has been certified triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. OK Computer included the singles "Paranoid Android", "Karma Police" and "No Surprises".\n\nThe album was recorded in rural Oxfordshire and Bath, England with Nigel Godrich, who would work with the band on all their future recordings. Although OK Computer was dominated by guitar, its expansive sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time, laying the groundwork for Radiohead\'s later, more experimental work. The lyrics, by Thom Yorke, and the album\'s artwork by Yorke and frequent collaborator Stanley Donwood, emphasised themes such as consumerism, social disconnection, political stagnation and modern malaise, though the band denied they set out to make a concept album.\n\n\nUpon its release, OK Computer received almost unanimously positive reviews. Consensus among critics was that the album was a landmark of its time and would have far-reaching impact and importance. NME gave the album a ten out of ten score, and reviewer James Oldham wrote "Here are 12 tracks crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that refuse to retread the successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation and surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of one man without ever considering sacrifice or surrender. In short, here is a landmark record of the 1990s, and one that deserves your attention more than any other released this year." Taylor Parkes of Melody Maker connected the album\'s release to the era\'s feeling of paranoia and alienation about millenarianism, and said "It\'s as pained and as slow-moving as the emotions that inspired it. ... In one way or another, Radiohead have excelled themselves." Q awarded the album five out of five stars, with writer David Cavanagh stating that "the majority of OK Computer\'s 12 songs ... takes place in a queer old landscape: unfamiliar and ominous, but also beautiful and unspoiled. ... It\'s a huge, mysterious album for the head and soul." Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that "Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years time I\'m betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era." In a four out of five stars review, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that the album "is surprising and sometimes inspiring but its intensity makes for a demanding listen."\n\nThe album was also favourably received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars. Reviewer Mark Kemp wrote that the album is "a stunning art-rock tour de force ... On OK Computer, Radiohead take the ideas they had begun toying with on The Bends into the stratosphere. ... OK Computer is evidence that Radiohead are one rock band still willing to look the devil square in the eyes", but warned "OK Computer is not an easy listen." An Entertainment Weekly review by David Browne gave the album a B+, and wrote that "When the arrangements and lyrics meander or sprout pretensions, the album grows ponderous and soggy. For all of Radiohead\'s growing pains, though, their aim \u2014 to take British pop to a heavenly new level \u2014 is true." In an article for The New Yorker, writer Alex Ross praised OK Computer for its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead\'s risk-taking with the more musically conservative "dadrock" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote that "Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme  This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock." Ryan Schreiber wrote, in a highly enthusiastic ten out of ten review in his online music magazine Pitchfork, that "Radiohead\'s third piece of incredible work, OK Computer, is not only their best yet, but one of the year\'s greatest releases. The record is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing."\n\nDespite OK Computer\'s widespread praise, it also received some criticism. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice granted OK Computer a B\u2212 but ranked it as the "Dud of the Month" in his consumer guide; Christgau commented that the album lacked "soul", calling it "arid" and "ridiculous" and comparing it unfavourably to Pink Floyd. Andy Gill wrote for The Independent in an otherwise positive review, "For all its ambition, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that so luxuriates in its despondency". While a review in Time was largely positive, particularly praising the songs "Airbag", "Paranoid Android", and "Let Down", reviewer Christopher John Farley criticised the second half of the album. Farley stated, "While the first half-dozen tracks reward repeated listenings with melodies that grow and bloom with familiarity, there is often no structure to be found in the remaining half-dozen numbers."\n\nAt the end of 1997, OK Computer appeared in many critics\' lists and listener polls for best album of the year. OK Computer topped the year-end polls of the magazines Mojo, Vox, Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly, and Inpress, and tied for first place with Daft Punk\'s Homework in The Face. The album placed second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and Uncut. Q and Les Inrockuptibles both listed OK Computer in their unranked year-end polls. OK Computer was a nominee for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognizing the best British or Irish album of the year. The album was nominated in the Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the latter award.\n\nOK Computer first appeared in a "best of all time" list three months after its release, placing 16 in a chart based on submissions by customers of Virgin Megastores. This chart heavily favoured recent releases, which suggested that OK Computer\'s popularity was a passing fad. However, OK Computer has since appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. In early 1998, OK Computer topped a Q reader\'s poll of the greatest albums of all time, and in 2001 Q placed it at number one in a list of the top 50 pop albums of the last 15 years. A number of publications, including NME, Melody Maker, Spin, Alternative Press, Pitchfork Media, and Time placed OK Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Additionally, retrospective reviews from The A.V. Club and Slant Magazine have received the album favourably; likewise, Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying "Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering."\n\n\nOK Computer was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election. It was thus seen by critics as encompassing public opinion through its "despairing-yet-hopeful tone" and themes of alienation. Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by reading a book about the two decades of Conservative government which were just coming to an end in 1997, as well as about factory farming and globalisation. However, in interviews Yorke expressed little hope things would change under the "New Labour" government of Tony Blair. With the approach of the year 2000, many people felt the tone of the album was millennial.\n\nSome critics have credited OK Computer with "killing" 1990s Britpop, as within a few years of its release, the dominant style of UK guitar pop had become slower and more melancholy. Many of the newer acts used similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements. The band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The Man Who, which became the biggest selling album of 1999 in the UK. Others have credited Radiohead with beginning a mainstream revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, though the band denied their affiliation with the genre. Radiohead described the prevalence of bands that "sound like us" as one reason to break with the style of OK Computer for their next album, Kid A. When asked by MTV interviewer Gideon Yago what the band thought of "bands like Travis, Coldplay, and Muse ... making a career sounding exactly like Radiohead did in 1997", Yorke replied "Good luck with \'Kid A\'!".\n\nSeveral rock bands which later became popular, ranging from Coldplay and Bloc Party to TV on the Radio, have said they were formatively influenced by OK Computer\u2014TV on the Radio\'s debut album, for instance, was titled OK Calculator. Additionally, the album\'s popularity paved the way for British alternative rock bands such as Muse, Snow Patrol, and Keane. Classical and jazz musicians such as Christopher O\'Riley and Brad Mehldau have performed material from OK Computer, and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said "When I heard \'OK Computer,\' after five minutes I said, \'I actually get this. I understand what these people are trying to do.\' And what they were trying was not so drastically different from what I was trying to do." Radiodread is a song for song cover of the album in a Reggae style.\n\nOK Computer has received great acclaim from the public and critics. It is often cited as Radiohead\'s best work and as a landmark album of its time. In 1998, it was nominated for a Grammy Award as Album of the Year, and won for Best Alternative Music Album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On the verge of a breakdown after promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical change in direction. Radiohead replaced their rock sound with synthesisers, drum machines, the ondes Martenot, string orchestras and brass instruments, incorporating influences from genres such as electronic music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music. They recorded Kid A with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20 tracks; Radiohead saved many of them for their subsequent album, Amnesiac, released the following year.\n\nRadiohead released no singles or music videos to promote Kid A and conducted few interviews and photoshoots, instead becoming one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool. The album was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services and the album was leaked before release.\n\nKid A debuted at the top of the charts in Britain, where it went platinum in the first week, and it became Radiohead's first number-one album in the United States. Like OK Computer, it won a Grammy for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. Its departure from Radiohead's earlier sound initially divided fans and critics, but it later attracted widespread acclaim; at the turn of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it number 67 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Kid+A\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on April 17, 2020, Apple\'s first release since The Idler Wheel... in 2012. The album was recorded from 2015 to 2020, largely at Apple\'s home in Venice Beach. It was produced and performed by Apple alongside Amy Aileen Wood, Sebastian Steinberg and Dav\xedd Garza; recording consisted of long, often-improvised takes with unconventional percussive sounds. GarageBand was used for much of this recording, and Apple credited the album\'s unedited vocals and long takes to her lack of expertise with the program.\n\nRooted in experimentation, the album largely features unconventional percussion. While conventional instruments, such as pianos and drum sets, do appear, the album also features prominent use of non-musical found objects as percussion. Apple described the result as "percussion orchestras". These industrial-like rhythms are contrasted against traditional melodies, and the upbeat songs often subvert traditional pop structures.\n\nThe album explores freedom from oppression; Apple identified its core message as: "Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\'re in". The title, a quote from TV series The Fall, reflects this idea. The album also discusses Apple\'s complex relationships with other women and other personal experiences, including bullying and sexual assault. It has nevertheless been referred to as Apple\'s most humorous album.\n\nFetch the Bolt Cutters was released during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many critics found its exploration of confinement timely. It received significant critical acclaim, and was described as an instant classic and Apple\'s best work to date. The album received a nomination for Best Alternative Music Album at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, whilst "Shameika" was nominated for Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance. The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums, with 44,000 equivalent album units. It also charted in the top 15 in Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2012, after releasing The Idler Wheel..., Apple began conceptualizing a new album, considering a concept album based on her home in Venice Beach or the Pando in Utah.\n\nIn February 2015, she began rehearsals for the album with band members Sebastian Steinberg, Amy Aileen Wood and Dav\xedd Garza. They began writing and rehearsing in Apple\'s Venice Beach home studio, using home-made percussive objects and chanting as they marched around the house.In July, they began recording the album, spending three weeks at the Sonic Ranch studio in rural Texas, where they recorded most of "Relay", "Ladies", "Cosmonauts" and "On I Go". Apple recalled that these sessions were often unproductive, with the band being distracted by magic mushrooms and films. They returned to Los Angeles, working on the material at Stanley Recordings. Apple decided that recording should relocate to her Venice Beach home studio, where they soon returned. She likened her house to "the womb of where I\'ve developed into an adult", so she chose to record the album at home to "repay" the house. She elaborated on the house\'s presence in the album: "I really felt like it\'s an instrument in itself, it\'s the microphone: The house is the microphone, the house is the ambiance, the house is a member of the band". Further sessions for "Newspaper" and "Heavy Balloon" took place at engineer Dave Way\'s private studio, Waystation.\n\nThey recorded long takes consisting of instruments being hit against surfaces and objects; her vocals were unedited, and the album developed a highly percussive sound. The sessions at Apple\'s home were largely recorded with GarageBand. On the long, unedited takes, Apple commented: "I didn\'t even know how to edit it and make a take shorter, so each track is just this one long take, and if I made a mistake in it, well, I better just play over it and let that mistake work itself into it". This resulted in what Apple described as "percussion orchestras", especially on "Newspaper" and the title track.\n\nBy July 2019, Apple had begun mixing the album. In September, the process began to slow down, with Apple developing doubts about the album. At this time, the artist first mentioned work on her new project in an interview with Vulture, explaining that she was still working hard on her next album which should have been released "a million years ago" and was hoping to put it out in 2020. She also admitted to being reclusive due to ongoing recording sessions at her Venice Beach house.\n\nIn January 2020, she played the mixes to her band members, whose positive responses brought Apple back on track. In an interview that month, she said that the album process was in its final stages, with the only things left being "artwork and stuff". In March, she announced that she had finished recording.\n\nThe album\'s sound is defined by percussion. The piano-playing typical to Apple\'s work is still evident, but takes a more percussive form. As well as drum sets and traditional percussion, the album features the use of found objects as percussion, such as a metal butterfly and the bones of Apple\'s deceased dog Janet. The experimental rhythms on the album evoke industrial music and are juxtaposed against more traditional melodies. Stereogum\'s Tom Breihan argues that while percussive music is typically "built around the idea of dancing, of guiding and channeling the rhythms of the human body", the album instead "plays as a wild, feverish attempt to mirror the chaos that goes on in the human mind when it\'s at its most overheated". Apple has attributed the album\'s prominent use of percussion to a childhood habit, developed as a part of her obsessive-compulsive disorder, in which she would always walk rhythmically to a strict tempo.\n\nThe album has been noted for its experimental approach to pop music. Critics have noted its ambition and originality. Nevertheless, it has been compared to the works of Joni Mitchell,Tom Waits, Nina Simone,and Kate Bush, who is quoted on the title track. The album often rejects popular music\'s traditional verse-chorus structure. The unpredictable songs feature looped sections, sudden stops and tempo changes.It has been noted as less melancholy than Apple\'s past work, with the uptempo songs being described as "funny, angry, and at times triumphant".The album features frequent improvisation, as well as background noise such as the barking of dogs, largely as a result of its home recording.\n\nOn the album, Apple approached her voice as a musical instrument, commenting: "I have fun with my voice, but I\'m not trying to make it pretty all the time. I\'m not trying to convince anybody I\'m a singer. It just turned out to be another instrument". Breihan noted that Apple demonstrates "a rapper\'s sense that words can be music", while The Guardian\'s Laura Barton highlighted the intimacy of Apple\'s vocals: "half-conversational, half-self-mutters, allowing every scuff, breath and feral yelp". Jon Pareles of The New York Times found that "whether she\'s cooing with sarcastic solicitousness or rasping close to a scream, she articulates every word clearly, emoting but never losing control".\n\nLyrically, Apple identified the album\'s main theme as "not being afraid to speak," with Barton similarly recognizing "a refusal to be silenced". Apple later said that this was an oversimplification, elaborating that "it\'s about breaking out of whatever prison you\'ve allowed yourself to live in," and pinpointing the message as: "Fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation you\'re in". She has said that writing the album helped free her of the ideas she had of herself, explaining that "this whole album, for me, has turned into the headache that I had inside of my head and now that it\'s released, it\'s like this pulse that now we can all share".  Pareles found that the album explored "both past and present injuries: bullying, sexual assault, destructive mind games, romantic debacles,  own fears and compulsions and the people who have taken advantage of them". The album explores freedom, with Breihan writing that "we can hear the euphoria of a great unburdening". The album has also been identified as Apple\'s most humorous album.\n\nAnother theme Apple explores on the album are her complex social relationships with other women.  Apple commented that these relationships began to suffer in middle school,  and the album features Apple trying to make peace with "the sorts of women that society has always deemed her \'competition\'", such as subsequent girlfriends of her exes.  Apple summarized this idea as "not letting men pit us against each other or keep us separate from each other so they can control the message"\n\nOn March 16, 2020, Apple announced the album and its title in an extensive New Yorker profile. At the start of April, she announced that the album was set to be released digitally on April 17. Epic Records had planned to release the album in October, due to promotional limitations brought by the coronavirus pandemic. However, Apple pushed to release the album early, both for the benefit of listeners who were under self-isolation, and so she could avoid stressful press commitments. Apple\'s friend King Princess also encouraged the early release. Critics have commented on the timeliness of releasing the album during the pandemic, finding thematic relevance in its exploration of confinement, and comparing Apple\'s reclusiveness to the widespread self-isolation restrictions.\n\nNo singles were issued from the album prior to its release, but "Shameika" was released to adult alternative radio on April 27 as the album\'s lead single. On November 20, a music video was released for the track, directed by Matthias Brown. The video features the voice of Shameika Stepney, the song\'s namesake, who reunited with Apple following the album\'s release. On the same day, Stepney released "Shameika Said", featuring vocals from Apple and samples of "Shameika".\n\nOn the US Billboard 200, Fetch the Bolt Cutters debuted at number four with 44,000 equivalent album units, marking the singer\'s third consecutive top 10 album, and her second-highest charting release; The Idler Wheel... reached number three in 2012. Of that sum, 30,000 are in album sales, 13,000 are in SEA units and less than 1,000 are in TEA units. It also debuted atop the Billboard charts for Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums. Outside of the US, the album reached the top ten in Canada, the top 15 in Australia and New Zealand, the top 40 in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, Scotland, Denmark, the UK and the Flanders region of Belgium, and the top 100 in Austria, Italy and France. Once the physical copies of the album were released in July, the album re-entered the Billboard 200 at number 60 with 6,500 sales. It also debuted at number one on the US Vinyl Album chart, making this her second consecutive album to achieve this.\n\nThe lead single "Shameika" peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs chart in June 2020; it was Apple\'s first entry on the chart since "Fast as You Can" in January 2000, breaking the record for the longest time between entries on the chart. The album\'s first five tracks all appeared on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart, as her first ever entries on the chart.\n\nPitchfork: 10/10\n\n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Fiona+Apple/Fetch+the+Bolt+Cutters">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Aughts",id:"complex-the-aughts",bookmarked:!1,albums:[{listeners:"1740973",playcount:"42058897",wiki:{published:"09 Sep 2020, 06:40",content:'Graduation is the third studio album by American rapper and producer Kanye West, released on September 11, 2007, through Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Recording sessions took place between 2005 and 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers. The album also features guest appearances from recording artists such as Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, DJ Premier, and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.\n\nInspired by stadium tours, house-music and indie rock, Graduation marked a departure from the ornate, soul-based sound of West\'s previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic compositions. West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. Graduation concludes the education theme of West\'s first two albums The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005).\n\nGraduation debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States and been certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits "Stronger", "Good Life" and "Homecoming", the former of which topped the Billboard Hot 100. The album received widely positive reviews from music critics, with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, as well as his third nomination for Album of the Year. It was named as one the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including Rolling Stone and USA Today, while also listed among numerous decade-end lists.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between Graduation and rapper 50 Cent\'s Curtis generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition with the latter marked the end of the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop. This is credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster conventions to find commercial acceptance.\n\nGraduation is the third installment of West\'s planned tetralogy of education-themed studio albums, which West subsequently later deviated from due to the events surrounding the conception of his fourth studio album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008).\u2019The album demonstrates yet another distinctive progression in West\'s musical style and approach to production. After spending the previous year touring the world with Irish rock band U2 on their Vertigo Tour, West became inspired by watching Bono open the stadium tours every night to incredible ovations and sought out to compose anthemic rap songs that could operate more efficiently in large stadiums and arenas. In West\'s attempt to accomplish this "stadium-status" endeavor, West incorporated layered electronic synthesizers into his hip-hop production, which also finds him utilizing slower tempos, being influenced by the music of the 1980s, and experimenting with electronic music. West was particularly influenced by house music, a subgenre of electronic dance music that first originated in his hometown of Chicago, Illinois in the early 1980s. West has stated that growing up, he would listen to hip-hop music at home or in his car, but when he felt like dancing, he would attend a house club. While he rarely listened to house at home, he still felt it was an important part of his culture and background.\n\nWest further broadened his musical palette on Graduation by not limiting himself to his customary use of samples and interpolation from classic soul records and instead drew influences from a far more eclectic range of music genres. Along with house music, Graduation contains samples and music elements of euro-disco, hard rock, electronica, lounge, progressive rock, synth-pop, electro, krautrock, dub, reggae, and dancehall. Also, for much of the third studio album, West modified his style of rapping and adopted a dilatory, exuberant flow in emulation of Bono\'s operatic singing. West altered his vocabulary, he utilised less percussive consonants for his vocal delivery in favor of smoother vowel harmonies. In addition to U2, West drew inspiration from other arena rock bands such as The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin for the melodies and chord progressions of his songs. In terms of lyricism, he simplifies some of his rhymes after touring with The Rolling Stones on their A Bigger Bang concert tour and discovering he could not captivate the audiences as well with his most complex lyrical themes.\n\nWest made a conscious decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Due largely to these factors and the inclusion of layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. He also acknowledged that the differences did not in and of themselves make Graduation a good album; however, he felt it was an accurate representation of the music he was listening to and inspired by at that time.\n\n <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Graduation">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on February 6, 2003, by Shady Records, G-Unit Records, Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. After signing with Eminem, 50 Cent also worked heavily with Dr. Dre, with the duo acting as the album\'s executive producers, who worked to combine the gangsta rap and R&B combo prevalent in New York hip hop. Additional production is provided by Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL, Mr. Porter, Rockwilder, Dirty Swift, and Megahertz.\n\nThe album also contains guest appearances from Eminem, Young Buck, and Nate Dogg, as well as features from G-Unit co-members Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Prior to the album, 50 Cent released several mixtapes alongside the Trackmasters on an unreleased album widely believed to be his debut in 2000. However, after suffering legal troubles and being blackballed from the music industry, 50 Cent found difficulty in securing another major-label recording contract, until he signed with Eminem\'s Shady Records in 2002.\n\nReleased a week in advance to combat bootlegging and internet leakage, Get Rich or Die Tryin\' debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling over 872,000 copies in its first week of sales. The album\'s singles also saw commercial success, with both "In da Club" and "21 Questions" reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100, while "P.I.M.P." became a number one hit in several countries. The album was ranked number one on the Billboard Year-End 2003 and received generally positive reviews from music critics.\n\nGet Rich or Die Tryin\' was ranked by several publications as one of the best albums of the 2000s. In 2020, it was certified 9\xd7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was the best-selling album of 2003 in the US, and was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 46th Grammy Awards. It won Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at 2003 American Music Awards and Top Billboard 200 Album at the 2003 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nPrior to the release of his mix-tape, 50 Cent was shot nine times in Queens, New York on May 24, 2000. He managed to survive, but was dropped from his label, Columbia Records, and remained unsigned and in need of producing new music. In 2002, Eminem listened to a copy of 50 Cent\'s Guess Who\'s Back? mix-tape album through Jackson\'s attorney, who was working with Eminem\'s manager Paul Rosenberg. After being impressed with the mixtape, Eminem invited 50 Cent to Los Angeles where he was introduced to producer Dr. Dre. 50 Cent signed a one million dollar record deal with Dr. Dre and released his next mixtape, No Mercy, No Fear. It featured the 8 Mile single, "Wanksta", which was later put on Get Rich or Die Tryin\'. Both Eminem and Dr. Dre had started working-productions on his debut album with additional help from producers Mike Elizondo, Sha Money XL among others.\n\nThe first single "In da Club" was the first of seven tracks he recorded in five days with Dr. Dre. Eminem was featured on a couple songs, such as "Patiently Waiting" and "Don\'t Push Me". His songs also featured rappers within G-Unit, such as Lloyd Banks ("Don\'t Push Me"), Tony Yayo ("Like My Style"), or Young Buck ("Blood Hound"). The next single "21 Questions" was not in line to be on the album to Dr. Dre, he stated that he did not want the song on the album. According to 50 Cent, "Dre was, like, \'How you goin\' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?\'" 50 Cent responded saying, "I\'m two people. I\'ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that\'s not diversity, it\'s necessity." "Back Down" was an instrumental originally composed by Dr. Dre. It was originally intended to be used on Rakim\'s debut Aftermath album, Oh My God, but due to creative differences was not released. Early pressings of Get Rich or Die Tryin\' included a limited edition bonus DVD. A music video for "Many Men (Wish Death)" was made. The song was also certified Gold by the RIAA on June 14, 2006. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/50+Cent/Get+Rich+or+Die+Tryin%27">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Released on April 1, 2003 on V2 Records, the album marks the band\'s major label debut. Despite this change, Heather Phares of Allmusic believed the album "sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid, and stunning than its predecessor\u2026Darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells." The record garnered much critical acclaim upon its release, and went on to win a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 2004.\n\nElephant"  is a strong, deep album showcasing Jack White at the top of his game. He rocks every guitar style that he tries including blues and slide guitar and even does a great job on a Burt Bacharach cover. It\'s just one more  example of Detroit\'s enduring musical legacy. \n\nElephant was recorded in two weeks during 2002 in London\'s Toe Rag Studios. Jack White produced the album with antiquated equipment, including an eight-track tape machine and pre-1960s recording gear.\n\nThe album has been released with at least six different versions of the front cover\u2014different covers for the CD and LP editions in the US, the UK and elsewhere. To give an example, on the US CD edition Meg White is sitting on the left of a circus travel trunk and Jack is sitting on the right holding a cricket bat over the ground, while on the UK CD edition the cricket bat touches the ground and the image is mirrored so that their positions on the amplifier are reversed. The cryptic symbolism of the album art includes a skull sitting on the floor in the background, as well as peanuts and peanut shells in the foreground, and on the circus travel trunk appears the mark "III," Jack White\'s signature. Jack White is also displaying a mano cornuta, while Meg White appears to be barefoot and crying, with a rope tied around her ankle and leading out of frame. Both have small white ribbons tied to their fingers.\n\nIn an interview with Q Magazine in 2007, Jack White said, "If you study the picture carefully, Meg and I are elephant ears in a head-on elephant. But it\'s a side view of an elephant, too, with the tusks leading off either side." He went on to say, "I wanted people to be staring at this album cover and then maybe two years later, having stared at it for the 500th time, to say, \'Hey, it\'s an elephant!\'"\n\nThe White Stripes were gaining momentum with their previous three albums and were generally lauded in critical circles. Upon its release, critical response to this album was overwhelmingly positive, and many critics hailed it as the one of the defining events of the 2000s garage rock revival. Uncut magazine remarked that "Elephant is where the tabloid phenomenon of summer 2001 prove they are no flash in the pan by making a truly phenomenal record." David Fricke (with Rolling Stone) called it "a work of pulverizing perfection," adding, "It will be one of the best things you hear all year." and Allmusic said the album "overflows with quality". Critics also commented on the development of the band. NME noted that "The eloquence, barbarism, tenderness and sweat-drenched vitality of Elephant make it the most fully-realised White Stripes album yet." PopMatters said the album cemented "their evolution from Blind Willie McTell cover band with a pop sensibility to full-fledged, honest-to-goodness rock \'n\' roll gods." The album enjoys a metacritic rating of 92. Negative critique, though rare, was centered around the "gimmicks" that surround the music, most notably, the White Stripes\' insistence on being called siblings. "So maybe it\'s time to drop the enigmatic charade," Lorraine Ali (with Newsweek) pleaded, although she concluded, "Elephant still sounds great."\n\nThe album debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and reached number six on the Billboard 200 in the US. The album won Grammys for Best Alternative Album and Best Rock Song ("Seven Nation Army"). In 2003, the album was ranked number 390 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was also placed thirty-ninth in Channel 4\'s list of the 100 Greatest Albums of all time. In December 2003, NME made it their Album of the Year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/Elephant">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

FutureSex/LoveSounds was primarily produced by Timbaland, Danja, and Timberlake himself. The album features lyrical themes concerning sex and love, and it contains musical styles such as R&B, dance-pop, and electronic.\n\nThe album was released after a four year gap in which it was revealed that Timberlake was in musical hiatus and felt unable to write anything. It was reported that as Justified was in the making for decades, it would be a challenge for Timberlake to produce an album that would be as successful as his debut. FutureSex/LoveSounds received generally positive reviews from most music critics, based on an aggregate score of 70 out of 100 from Metacritic. The album exceeded expectations and sold in excess of 9 million copies, with 4 million copies sold in the United States alone, and the thirty best-selling album of the 2000s\n\nTimberlake released his debut album, Justified, in 2002, and spawned the US top five hit "Rock Your Body". However, it was the alleged girlfriend-dumping-themed "Cry Me a River"\u2014because of Timberlake\'s concluded ten-year relationship with pop contemporary Britney Spears\u2014with a video featuring a woman sporting references to Spears, which propelled the album into charts. Justified eventually sold up to four million copies in the United States. With the commercially and critically successful debut that established Timberlake outside the realm of his then-former band \'N Sync, however, he was only twenty-two years old and at a crossroads that made him feel "burnt" out. He thought he lost his voice in the sense of "knowing what and how he wanted to sing". Justified was "decades in the making" and would be a challenge for him to follow a similar album; so, he needed a break.\n\nIn the following two years, Timberlake turned partially idle in the recording industry. He immersed himself in athletic activities, and was lounging in his house during weekends. Timberlake reflects, "Oh, shit! This is what the world looks like at a regular pace." His being burnt out partly caused him to try acting in movies. In October 2003, he hosted and was the musical guest on the American late-night variety show Saturday Night Live and showcased his acting abilities in a parody to American actor Ashton Kutcher and American singer-actress Jessica Simpson. Later, he paired American actor Jimmy Fallon on The Barry Gibb Talk Show and, in the words of Fallon, impressed him and the crew with having a great comedic timing. After the show, Timberlake was overwhelmed with acting offers, and readily accepted them because he was also lacking an inspiration at that time and did not want to miss out on opportunities. As he wanted to do it the right way, he chose roles and directors he thought were "cool". Before the year ends, Timberlake shot the movie Edison Force and acted in the following year for another three lined-up films, including Alpha Dog.\n\nTimberlake opted not to pursue the reunion with \'N Sync that he considered after Justified. According to him, he was concerned with how they would reinvent their music: "OK, what are we gonna do? What we did doesn\'t work now. How would we reinvent what we do?\' I don\'t think the answer came to any of us." In late 2004, Timberlake contacted record producers Rich Harrison and Rodney Jerkins, whom the latter had previously produced songs with \'N Sync, for possible collaboration on the new album. Both producers were interested and were already preparing something for him in the time. They liked the live band-driven late-night shows of Timberlake and wanted to incorporate it in his music. While in the trailer during shootings, Timberlake attempted to write songs and conceptualize, and had guitar and keyboard with him. However, it was unproductive: "I just needed a little bit of time away from touring and promoting and I just needed a little time to live."\n\nIn 2005, Timberlake was inspired to make records again. He felt he needed to experiment and create something new. Also, according to him, he was motivated by the sad state of the pop radio and dismissed the idea of doing something that would sound alike. So, he turned again to his Justified collaborator, record producer Timbaland, whom he admired for being "not afraid to move outside of his box".\n\nIn November 2005, he visited Thomas Crown Studios, Timbaland\'s studio, in Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States. However, they lacked direction as to what the album should be. Record producer Danja, a prot\xe9g\xe9 of Timbaland, recalled, "We had no direction at all ... There was no direction for how he wanted the song to sound, because there was no direction for how he wanted  to sound." There was no game plan and even a working title: "Nobody had a thought about anything. None of us was aiming for anything." Timberlake thought that if he could make a record that would live up to Justified, he "would have"; so, he asked Timbaland if he could reproduce the likes of "Cry Me a River" by four or six times. While in the studio, Timbaland was supplying them something to eat and listen to, and was just "fooling" around and "free styling". Also that night, Danja was playing a guitar riff and caught the attention of Timberlake. The latter then came up with a melody and lyrics. Timbaland was at their side and was adding drums into the progressing sound. With no written lyrics, Timberlake recorded it in the vocal booth that would become a song called "What Goes Around". The collective was adding everything they felt was fitting to the song, and when done they teased each other until they decided to proceed onto making a new album. Timberlake responded to Timbaland: "Let\'s do something we would never do. Let\'s go far left and just see what happens." Timbaland, who is creative according to Timberlake, took it as a challenge.\n\nOfficial production of FutureSex/LoveSounds started in December 2005. Timberlake proceeded sluggishly for a few weeks, working on and off in the studio. When production began, Jive Records president Barry Weiss asked him when would the album be done. Timberlake replied: "I don\'t know, it could take a year." Timberlake did not recruit many musical collaborators because he was happy with his small cast, saying "they\'re heavy hitters". In three weeks time, the collective was able to create songs like "My Love", "SexyBack", and "Sexy Ladies". In early January 2006, Timberlake and the producers were able to compose over a dozen of songs. Timbaland, the veteran among his collaborators, produced the majority of the album, while Justified-co-producers The Neptunes were not able to work with Timberlake again because of a dispute between them and Jive Records. The title of the album was not yet conceptualized although release date was already slated. The title was not finalized until Jive Records gave Timberlake a deadline on finishing what would become FutureSex/LoveSounds.\n\nWith no concrete plans, however, Timberlake\'s goal of the album was "\'to capture moments\' with a vivid, raw, off-the-cuff sound". They described the sessions as free-flowing. Timberlake, who included record production in his repertoire, managed the process with no formula. On songs like "SexyBack", they would go around the studio coming up with beats. Timberlake referred to themselves as "looking like a mad man, a mad scientist". The collective thought the album best equated to Michael Jackson\'s landmark record, Thriller, dubbing it as FS/LS Thriller 2006\u2014Timberlake admitted he is a fan of Jackson and even name drops him in the song "Chop Me Up".\n\nThe album\'s lyrics were never written down on paper, as Timberlake claimed it would only slow him down. For instance, the lyrics for "What Goes Around" were composed in his head with the song being recorded shortly after. Some songs were conceptualized within a relatively short time, while others took longer because Timberlake wanted to do some tricks. For instance, the lyrics to "Losing My Way" were written in a more narrative style which took Timberlake longer to write. The only song he wrote down on paper was "(Another Song) All Over Again", a collaboration Timberlake did with record producer Rick Rubin. Rubin felt it was unusual for Timberlake because he requested him to write the lyrics before going in the studio instead of hitting it directly in the vocal booth. The idea of teaming up with Rubin emanated from actor Chris Rock, who recommended him to Timberlake. He considered the idea good and, when he saw Rubin at Coachella, California, United States, he approached him and talked over the idea. Timberlake went to Neil Diamond\'s studio and Rubin played him some demos, one of which a ballad that became "(Another Song) All Over Again". Timberlake felt that this song challenged him to better his songwriter skill.\n\nWith FutureSex/LoveSounds, Timberlake wanted to play rock & roll instead of the R&B and pop genres he combined in Justified. Besides bands like The Strokes, The Killers, Arcade Fire, and Radiohead, he wanted to channel the English rock band Coldplay whom he deemed serious in their music. As major producer of the album, Timbaland retreated from the idea because he was not accustomed to that kind of music. However, he was thinking of making only a handful of such songs to be tested since they were afraid of alienating the urban fan base Timberlake had gathered since his debut album. Timbaland recalled, "We just can\'t go the Coldplay route." Enabling them to do it, they produced several interludes and reprises instead of full songs. They anticipated that Timberlake\'s fans would be irritated or intrigued.\n\nFutureSex/LoveSounds is musically distinct from Justified. Although "What Goes Around"\'s sound is relatively similar to Justified, Timberlake said that it is the only closest song to the album. Timberlake called the music of the album a "fly by the seat of your pants" kind of style. "It\'s less concentrated to  one sound. It\'s more broad as far as the styles I wanted to mix in to my own type of thing." Many of the songs were composed with varied instrumentation, but predominantly used guitar and piano. Since Justified, Timberlake has said that he wants to be recognized as an R&B artist because it was the kind of music he grew up listening to. His admiration to rock icons is evident in FutureSex/LoveSounds. Timberlake said the influence English rock musician David Bowie and late INXS frontman Australian singer-songwriter Michael Hutchence had on him is reflected in the album. He said that he admired these rock bands because he felt that "they were capturing something raw and unrehearsed".\n\nFutureSex/LoveSounds generally contains songs with sexual innuendo and themes of love. The album, if summarized, "...is about the very nature of how sex and love are interchangeable and immutable and contradictory and complementary all at once, so that the same words mean different things depending on what music is played or what mood is set." Timberlake said that songs in the album were motivated by these two recurring themes. The first half of the album, the FutureSex, generally focuses on sex. For instance, the track "FutureSex/LoveSound" is sexually suggestive. Other sensual songs like "LoveStoned" contain lyrics "She\'s going home with me tonight" and in "Damn Girl", "from Casanova to supernova". The second half, LoveSounds, is the album\'s "sweet side" and this is evident in some of the preludes. "What Goes Around", for instance, is considered an emotional song; "LoveStoned" transitions to a two-minute love songs (I Think She Knows). Although the album has lyrical themes, it is completely un-autobiographical. The only song which hints of Timberlake\'s own experiences is "What Goes Around". Its lyrics suggests a sequel to "Cry Me a River", but Timberlake closed the speculation himself, declaring that the song was written about one of his friends, who had gone through a similar situation. Although sex and love are dominant in the entire album, the song "Losing My Way" diverges to a more serious topic; this song was inspired by a documentary of a crystal meth addiction which Timberlake watched. "(Another Song) All Over Again," is a homage to Donny Hathaway as stated by Timberlake. He considers Donny Hathaway to be "the best singer of all time."\n\nFutureSex/LoveSounds was released in the United States on September 12, 2006. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, the official US album chart, with first week sales of over 684,000. This was Timberlake\'s first time at number one as a solo artist after peaking at number two with Justified in 2002. The album has sold over four million units in the United States, and has been certified four-time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nFutureSex/LoveSounds was the eighteenth best-selling album of 2006 in the United States. Internationally, the album was also well-received, being Sony BMG\'s biggest selling album of 2006 and became the biggest pre-order album in iTunes history and broke the all time record for one week sales of a digital album previously held by Coldplay. The album debuted at number one in Australia, and has since certified five-time platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association with shipments of over 350,000 units. FutureSex/LoveSounds is the thirty-fourth best-selling album of 2006 in Australia, and third the following year. Across Europe, the album peaked inside the Top 10 in most countries. The album debuted at number one in Ireland and the United Kingdom; it also opened at number two in Sweden and Switzerland.\n\nA deluxe version of the album was released on November 27, 2007. The revamped edition features several guests; including a duet version of "Until the End of Time" with Beyonc\xe9 Knowles and the remix version of "Sexy Ladies" featuring vocals by hip hop artist 50 Cent. The deluxe version of the album was released on as a digipak. It includes a bonus DVD which featuring live performances by Timberlake, music videos of all the album\'s singles except "Until The End of Time" and "Chop Me Up", Behind-the-Scene footages of the making of some music videos. On this version, both the CD and the DVD contain the clean versions of the songs. Seven singles were released from FutureSex/LoveSounds: "SexyBack", "My Love", "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around", "Summer Love", "LoveStoned/I Think She Knows", "Until the End of Time", and "Chop Me Up". First three singles were consecutive number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, making Timberlake the first male artist to have three or more consecutive number-one hits from one album since Usher achieved it in 2004. Timberlake embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour in January of 2007. Guests were rap group Three 6 Mafia, T.I., and the album\'s producers will.i.am, Timbaland, and Danja.\n\nTimberlake\'s collaboration with Timbaland received mixed response from critics. A review from the US daily newspaper The New York Times reads: "How well do Mr. Timberlake and Timbaland work together? So well that they can make even the world\'s most irritating percussion instrument, the human beatbox, sound pretty good." On the October 2006 issue of the Vibe magazine, a reviewer says, "Timberlake and Timbalandwrite frustratingly awkward songs."\n\nOn the October 2006 issue of the British music magazine Q, a review states, " set of forward-thinking pop reminiscent of Sign O\' The Times-era Prince." Ben Williams of New York magazine praised Timberlake as one of the white singers who is brave for producing black music. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the online music database Allmusic commented that Timberlake has "a clear musical vision" in the album.\n\nKaty Kroll of the music magazine Billboard says: "Although the mix of dance beats, pounding basslines and palatable vocals is occasionally marred by mundane R&B tracks like "Until the End of Time," there are far more pop gems than slow jams. The sound may be a bit different, but the music\'s sex appeal remains a force to be reckoned with." Robert Christgau of the Rolling Stone magazine commented that although "some of the up-tempo stuff flirts with mechanical muscle-flexing", Timberlake\'s "best new tracks are thrilling".\n\nIn 2007, the album received four nominations at the Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Pop Vocal Album. Timberlake lost the two; however, he won the Best Dance Recording for "SexyBack" and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for "My Love", The following year at the Grammys, "What Goes Around.../...Comes Around" was nominated for Record of the Year; Timberlake won Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for the same song and another Best Dance Recording for "LoveStoned/I Think She Knows". The Rolling Stone magazine listed FutureSex/LoveSounds as their 26th among 2006\'s top 50 albums of the year. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Justin+Timberlake/FutureSex%2FLoveSounds">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

fourth studio album by American rapper Eminem. After it had originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002, the album was released in May 26, 2002, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records due to pirating and bootlegging of it. The album saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass, and Dr. Dre being the album\'s executive producer. It features guest appearances from Obie Trice, D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Dina Rae and Eminem\'s daughter Hailie Jade Scott-Mathers.\n\nThe album incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem\'s previous albums, and its themes are predominantly based on Eminem\'s prominence in hip hop culture, as well as his ambivalent thoughts of fame. The album also features political commentary on the United States, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the War on terror, President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, The Eminem Show was regarded as Eminem\'s most personal album at the time and a step back from the Slim Shady alter ego.\n\nWidely considered the most anticipated album of 2002, The Eminem Show debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and stood there for six non-consecutive weeks. It sold over 1.3 million copies in its second week in the US, where it registered a full week of sales. It also topped the UK Albums Chart for five consecutive weeks. It produced four commercially successful singles, "Without Me", "Cleanin\' Out My Closet", "Superman", and "Sing for the Moment". The album was met with positive critical reviews, with praise directed at Eminem\'s mature, introspective lyricism and the album\'s experimental production.\n\nThe Eminem Show was both the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States and the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. It was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its worldwide sales of over 27 million copies make it one of the best-selling albums of all time and the third best-selling album of the 21st century. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album, while "Without Me" won Best Music Video. Blender, Muzik and LAUNCH named it the best album of 2002, and several publications named it among the best albums of the 2000s decade.\n\nBackground\n\nSpeaking to Spin, Eminem said, "Eventually, I might need some drama in my life to inspire me  With The Marshall Mathers LP, everything that everybody was saying\u2013I took that, and it was my ammo. And then when shit died down a little bit, I had other turmoil in my personal life, so that was what I was able to dump out on The Eminem Show. Now, I just gotta wait for the next phase of my life. But something always seems to happen, man; something\'s always gotta be fucking turbulent."\n\nEminem cited that the inspiration for the album was taken from the Peter Weir-directed 1998 science fiction comedy-drama film The Truman Show. Jim Carrey starred in the film as the lead character Truman Burbank, a man who unwittingly lives inside a TV show, where his life is broadcast to viewers around the world. Eminem spoke on the film\'s influence, saying, "My life felt like it was becoming a circus around that time, and I felt like I was always being watched  Basically, Jim Carrey wrote my album.\n\nRecording\n\nSpeaking with Rolling Stone in 2002, Eminem said ""Sing for the Moment" was the first song I wrote for the album; "Cleanin Out My Closet" was the second. I had the line in "Cleanin Out My Closet" \u2014 "I\'d like to welcome y\'all out to The Eminem Show" \u2014 and it was just a line, but I sat back and I was like, "My life is really like a fucking show." I have songs on the album that I wrote when I was in that shit last year, with a possible jail sentence hangin\' over my head and all the emotions going through the divorce. I went through a lot of shit last year  that I resolved at the same time, all in the same year. And, yeah, that\'s when half of the album was wrote.\n\nEminem had started recording the album around the same time he was filming 8 Mile. Production was used for both the soundtrack of the film and his album. The album also saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass co-producing several tracks (mainly the songs which eventually, became the released singles). Dr. Dre, in addition to being the album\'s executive producer, produced only three individual tracks: "Business", "Say What You Say", and "My Dad\'s Gone Crazy". Regarding his increase in producing, Eminem told Rolling Stone, "I actually know how to program a drum machine now. It used to be so simple \u2014 just writing lyrics and raps, laying vocals and leaving the studio was great. But now that I\'m so into producing, it\'s a fucking job.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nStylistically, The Eminem Show has a lighter tone than The Marshall Mathers LP and incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem\'s previous albums, featuring mixed guitar-driven melodies with hip hop rhythms. In an interview with British magazine The Face in April 2002, Eminem said that he treated the album like it was a rock record. He continued that he "tried to get the best of both worlds" on the album. Eminem spoke on specific rock influences, saying, "I listened to a lot of \'70s rock growing up, when I was real little. When I go back and listen to them songs, like Led Zeppelin or Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix...\'70s rock had this incredible feel to it. Notably, "Sing For The Moment" contains a sample of Aerosmith\'s "Dream On" as well as a reinterpretation of its guitar solo. Another rock sample on the album is the kick-clap beat of "\'Till I Collapse", which is an interpolation of the intro from Queen\'s "We Will Rock You".\n\nThe themes of The Eminem Show are predominantly based on Eminem\'s prominence in hip hop culture and the subsequent envy towards him, as well as his thoughts on his unexpected enormous success and its consequential negative effects on his life. The album also touches on Eminem\'s thoughts on themes surrounding American politics, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the war on terror President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Speaking on his use of political commentary on the album, Eminem told Rolling Stone, "You put your shit out there for the world to see and to judge, and whoever agrees with you agrees with you. Even my most die-hard fans don\'t agree with everything I say. These are my views, this is how I see it. You may have your own opinion, but you may not get to project it to the world like I do. Writing for Spin, rock critic Alan Light said that the album may have proved that Eminem is the most "dexterous, vivid writer in pop music". The album also sees Eminem dissing several artists, including Mariah Carey, Moby, Canibus and Limp Bizkit, while Dr. Dre disses Jermaine Dupri on the song "Say What You Say".\n\nLyrically, the album shows Eminem\'s personal and musical growth with there being a lack of misogyny and homophobia compared to The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem told Spin, "One of the frustrating things was people saying, \'He\'s got to cuss to sell records,\'  That\'s why with this album, I toned it down a bit as far as shock value. I wanted to show that I\'m a solid artist, and I\'m here to stay. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, The Eminem Show was regarded as a departure from Eminem\'s previous albums. with it being more personal and reflective and a step back of the Slim Shady alter ego. Eminem said during an interview with MTV that he felt that The Eminem Show was his "best record so far". In 2006, Q said that Eminem\'s first two albums "aired dirty laundry, then the world\'s most celebrated rapper  examined life in the hall of mirrors he\'d built for himself.\n\nWith the release of The Eminem Show, Eminem was considered to be more socially acceptable: there were no protests over his lyrics, boycotts, and talk shows discussing his impact on America\'s youth. A columnist of The New York Observer wrote that Eminem had become a "guilty pleasure" for baby boomers, describing him as "the most compelling figure to have emerged from popular music since the holy trinity of  Dylan,  Lennon, and  Jagger.\n\nCensored version\n\nThe "clean version" of The Eminem Show censors many more profanities and derogatory words than in clean versions of Eminem\'s previous albums, in which the words "goddamn", "prick", "bastard", "piss", "bitch", "ass", and "shit" were allowed. This album allowed no profanities, and the profanities were either muted, obscured by sound effects, or back-masked. In addition to this, entire sentences were sometimes removed from the censored version for being very sexually charged. The entire song "Drips" was removed in early clean versions and is heard only as four seconds of silence moving on to the next track, "Without Me". Later on, digital releases of the clean version removed "Drips" completely, moving the next 11 songs up on the tracklist. Some copies of the clean version, however, feature an edited version of "Drips".\n\nThere are some inconsistencies in clean version\'s censorship. In the skit "The Kiss", Eminem\'s shouting of the word "motherfucker!" is still audible in the censored version. In the track, "Soldier", which is a continuation of "The Kiss", the word "bitch" was used three times, and can be clearly heard once. "Hailie\'s Song" contains the back masked phrase "want her" which can be easily mistaken as "abort her" on both the explicit and clean versions. Also, in "White America", the word "flag" is back masked when he raps, "To burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker".\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Eminem Show was met with generally positive reviews upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 20 reviews.\n\nAlex Needham of NME hailed The Eminem Show as a "fantastic third album" that "is bigger, bolder and far more consistent than its predecessors". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly felt the album\'s more personal lyrics "succeed in fleshing out Eminem\'s complexities and contradictions", nonetheless concluding that "ike its predecessors, though, The Eminem Show is a testament to the skills of its star. The sludgy rapping of such guests as D12 only confirms Eminem\'s dizzying prowess, gob-spewing individuality, and wickedly prankish humor. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kris Ex argued that Eminem "may have made the best rap rock album in history.\n\nSlant Magazine\'s Sal Cinquemani wrote that he "peels back some of the bullshit fa\xe7ade and reveals a little bit of the real Marshall Mathers" on an album that "displays a\u2014dare I say it?\u2014more \'mature\' Eminem. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the album "proves Eminem is the gold standard in pop music in 2002, delivering stylish, catchy, dense, funny, political music that rarely panders". Critic Robert Christgau wrote: "I think it represents an articulate, coherent, formally appropriate response to Eminem\'s changing position and role, one that acknowledges the privileges and alienations that accrue to all fame as well as the resolution of Marshall Mathers\'s worst traumas and the specifics of his success.\n\nEdna Gundersen of USA Today wrote that Eminem is "as good as he gets but in the end inflicts more damage on himself, hoisting The Eminem Show to a level of self-absorption rivaled only by Woody Allen", and despite the presence of some mediocre tracks, he "displays an admirable dexterity in blending invective and invention, even though his approach is more reactionary than revolutionary. Uncut wrote, "Behind the hype and the swagger, he\'s still baring enough of his soul for The Eminem Show to be compelling theatre. Q was more mixed in its assessment, stating that as "Eminem outgrows his old alter-id, so the obligatory pantomime villainy, skits and crass cameos by Shady Records signings become a hindrance. Marc L. Hill of PopMatters felt that the album lacked the shock factor of his previous albums and described it as "a disappointing combination of promising musical experimentation and uninspired lyrics.\n\nOn June 3, 2002, Pitchfork Media\'s Ethan P. published a review of The Eminem Show which infamously consisted of a meandering stream of consciousness monologue. While giving it a 9.1/10, P. vulgarly and comedically criticized various aspects of the album, including its lead singles, its lyrics, and especially "My Dad\'s Gone Crazy", which he described as a "saccharine-sweetened lemon incest gone faggy". The review, making use of line breaks and written entirely in lowercase, referred in one section to "the him fucking dre thing / dyeing your hair and wearing earrings thing from the aerosmith song / or hailie being \'the only lady he adores\' / sleazy disco / little eric and erica / dre is batman and he\'s the burt ward robin / etc". Despite its comedically self-referential sections, including a paragraph where P. states "if you\'re reading this sentence then wow i really got an unedited review on pfork ", and several offhand remarks ("yeah dude timbaland is biting aphex twins white ass too haha i dunno fuck it here are some more bullshit things about the actual record like right on schedule pfork review style"), the review has remained on the Pitchfork website, and P.\'s rating for The Eminem Show continues to be the publication\'s official rating of the album.\n\nBlender, Muzik and LAUNCH named The Eminem Show the best album of 2002. The album became Eminem\'s third to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, while "Without Me" won Eminem his first Best Music Video award. The album swept the MTV Music Video Awards, winning four awards for Best Male Video, Video of the Year, Best Direction, and Best Rap Video. The album also won Best Album at the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, both Album of the Year and Top R&B/Hip Hop Album at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, both Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the 2003 American Music Awards, Best International Album at the 2003 Brit Awards, and International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2003.\n\nReappraisal\n\nThe Eminem Show received critical praise by most music critics and is often debated as Eminem\'s most personal and best work. The album cemented Eminem\'s "three-peat" of classic hip hop albums, following the critical appraisal of The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. In 2003, the album was ranked number 317 on Rolling Stone\'s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and was later ranked at number 84 on the same magazine\'s Best Albums of the 2000s Decade. In 2007, it was ranked number 63 by The National Association of Recording Merchandisers, in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their list of the Definite 200 Albums of All Time. In 2012, Complex magazine deemed it a "classic" album that "cemented Eminem\'s place as one of the most important figures in rap history", and has included it on their list of 100 Best Albums of the Complex Decade, placing it at number 5, Following the 15th anniversary of the album, the Grammy Awards also described The Eminem Show as a "classic album". Popdose ranked the album at 79 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. In 2015, The Eminem Show was ranked number 56 on the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Eminem Show was originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002; however, pirated and bootlegged copies appeared online via peer-to-peer networks and began surfacing on the streets. It was provided by Rabid Neurosis (RNS), an MP3 warez release organisation who pirated the album twenty-five days prior to release. Radio show Opie and Anthony broadcast the entire album on May 17, 2002. Interscope decided to release the album earlier than planned, on May 28 to prevent bootlegging. However, many stores in the United States began selling it even earlier than the new release date on Sunday, May 26, and some put the album out as early as Friday. Promotional posters in stores read, "America Couldn\'t Wait". Due to the premature release by many retailers on a Sunday, the album had only one day of official sales for the chart week and was unavailable in Walmart stores during that period. The Eminem Show was Eminem\'s first album to include lyrics to all its songs inside the CD booklet. Additionally, the first 2,000,000 copies of the album shipped in the United States included a bonus DVD with an exclusive interview and live footage. A week before the album\'s release, it was the second-most played CD on computers, the highest ranking ever for an unreleased title. It was considered the most anticipated album of 2002.\n\nDespite the confusion over the exact release date, the album still managed to have a very successful debut on the charts. The Eminem Show debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling approximately 284,000 copies in its first day, marking the first time an album had topped the chart from only a day\'s sale. It sold 1,322,000 copies in the following week, its first full week of sales, then sold 809,000 copies in its third week and 529,562 copies in its fourth week to bring its four-week sales total to just under 3 million copies. The album sold 381,000 copies in its fifth week and topped the Billboard 200 for a fifth and final consecutive week. On March 7, 2011, the album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping 10 million copies, making it Eminem\'s second album to receive a Diamond certification in the United States. It has also achieved Diamond certification in Canada and Double Diamond in Australia.\n\nThe Eminem Show has sold 27 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and Eminem\'s best-selling album. It reached number one in 18 other countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The album also spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/The+Eminem+Show">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

\u201cstudio\u201d album with an actual band, Will Toledo moves from bedroom pop to something approaching classic rock grandeur and huge (if detailed and personal) narrative ambitions, with nods to the Cars, Pavement, Jonathan Richman, Wire, and William Onyeabor. Teens of Denial refracts Toledo\u2019s particular, personal story of one difficult year through cultural touchstones such as the biography of Frank Sinatra, the evolution of the Me Generation as seen in Mad Men and elsewhere, plus elements of eastern and western theology. The whole thing flaunts a kind of conceptual, lyrical, and musical ambition that has been missing from far too much 21st-century music. Horns, keyboards, and elegant instrumental interludes set off art-garage moments; vivid vocal harmonies follow punk frenzy. The selfish captain of the capsized cruise liner in the Mediterranean in 2013 becomes a metaphor for struggles of the individual in society, as experienced by one hungover young man on the verge of adulthood. The album was produced by Steve Fisk (Nirvana, Beat Happening, Soundgarden) at his studio in Seattle, July-September 2015.

album by American rock band Daughters. It was released on October 26, 2018, through Ipecac Recordings. It is the band\'s first album since they broke up in late 2009. The album was released to universal critical acclaim, with many critics naming it one of the best albums of 2018. It marks a significant departure from the band\'s earlier style, moving away from mathcore towards a more industrial and noise rock influenced sound.\n\nThe album was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 87, based on 11 reviews, which indicates "universal acclaim". The album was included on numerous end-of-year lists as one of the best albums of 2018. Pitchfork wrote that "Similar to their Providence art-metal contemporaries in the Body, Daughters\u2019 accessibility is directly proportional to their uncompromising compositional choices\u2014hypnotic dissonance, martial drums cranked to incapacitating volumes, scathing vocal repetition, all rendered through impossibly vivid production. This is not music interesting in growing on you: it consumes and dominates." PopMatters called it "the perfect return for Daughters. While aspects of the band\'s creative vision have been altered and their sound has further evolved, the core elements remain intact. The asphyxiating sound has been augmented with the inclusion of longer, heavier sludge influenced moments. The tension the band build is further explored through different means."\n\nCredits (adapted from liner notes):\n\nAll lyrics written by Alexis Marshall; all music composed by Nick Sadler.\n\nDaughters: \nAlexis S.F.

The band has made apparent via social media that they had been working with ambitious collaborators for the creation of the project throughout the promotion of the album, including in-studio collaborations with Australian experimental musician Lucas Abela, New Zealand film director Andrew Adamson and Tool bassist Justin Chancellor.\n\nThe band posted a black and white image of text reading "Year of the Snitch - new album coming soon..." on their official webpage on March 22, 2018. Death Grips shared the album artwork for Year of the Snitch on April 6, 2018. The band\'s imprint label Third Worlds\' website was also updated with this information.\n\nThe tracklist for the album was released on April 11, through a video posted to social media and the band\'s YouTube channel. The video consisted of the track names being sent via SMS to the user of an iPhone through a screen recorder, while short videos played in the foreground. Accompanying the differing ringtones, screamed vocals of the band\'s frontman MC Ride can be heard.\n\nDeath Grips uploaded a music video for the track "Streaky" on their YouTube channel on May 5, 2018, as the album\'s first single, followed by the track "Black Paint" on May 15, and the music video for the third album single, "Flies", on May 22.\n\nThe band posted a short video to Instagram on May 23, featuring DJ Swamp performing on a turntable in a recording studio, with the caption stating that "the majority of Year of the Snitch features ".\n\nThe fourth single, "Hahaha", was uploaded by the band to their YouTube page on June 7. That same day, the album\'s release date was announced as June 22. A music video for the track "Dilemma" featuring Andrew Adamson was uploaded on the Death Grips YouTube channel on June 15. A sixth single, "Shitshow", was uploaded to YouTube two days later. Three days later, on June 20, the official video for "Shitshow" was released. It was directed by Zach Hill and Galen Pehrson. However, the video\'s extremely explicit nature led to YouTube taking down the video and giving Death Grips\' channel a community strike, after which the band re-uploaded the music video to Vimeo. The album leaked online on 21st June, and was officially released on streaming platforms on 22nd June, as well as on Death Grips\' YouTube. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Grips/Year+of+the+Snitch">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Radiohead, released in 1997. It reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart and marked Radiohead\'s highest entry into the American market at the time, where it debuted at #21. OK Computer expanded the band\'s worldwide popularity, becoming the last Radiohead album to have a delayed release outside of the United Kingdom. As of 2007, it has been certified triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. OK Computer included the singles "Paranoid Android", "Karma Police" and "No Surprises".\n\nThe album was recorded in rural Oxfordshire and Bath, England with Nigel Godrich, who would work with the band on all their future recordings. Although OK Computer was dominated by guitar, its expansive sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time, laying the groundwork for Radiohead\'s later, more experimental work. The lyrics, by Thom Yorke, and the album\'s artwork by Yorke and frequent collaborator Stanley Donwood, emphasised themes such as consumerism, social disconnection, political stagnation and modern malaise, though the band denied they set out to make a concept album.\n\n\nUpon its release, OK Computer received almost unanimously positive reviews. Consensus among critics was that the album was a landmark of its time and would have far-reaching impact and importance. NME gave the album a ten out of ten score, and reviewer James Oldham wrote "Here are 12 tracks crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that refuse to retread the successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation and surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of one man without ever considering sacrifice or surrender. In short, here is a landmark record of the 1990s, and one that deserves your attention more than any other released this year." Taylor Parkes of Melody Maker connected the album\'s release to the era\'s feeling of paranoia and alienation about millenarianism, and said "It\'s as pained and as slow-moving as the emotions that inspired it. ... In one way or another, Radiohead have excelled themselves." Q awarded the album five out of five stars, with writer David Cavanagh stating that "the majority of OK Computer\'s 12 songs ... takes place in a queer old landscape: unfamiliar and ominous, but also beautiful and unspoiled. ... It\'s a huge, mysterious album for the head and soul." Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that "Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years time I\'m betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era." In a four out of five stars review, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that the album "is surprising and sometimes inspiring but its intensity makes for a demanding listen."\n\nThe album was also favourably received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars. Reviewer Mark Kemp wrote that the album is "a stunning art-rock tour de force ... On OK Computer, Radiohead take the ideas they had begun toying with on The Bends into the stratosphere. ... OK Computer is evidence that Radiohead are one rock band still willing to look the devil square in the eyes", but warned "OK Computer is not an easy listen." An Entertainment Weekly review by David Browne gave the album a B+, and wrote that "When the arrangements and lyrics meander or sprout pretensions, the album grows ponderous and soggy. For all of Radiohead\'s growing pains, though, their aim \u2014 to take British pop to a heavenly new level \u2014 is true." In an article for The New Yorker, writer Alex Ross praised OK Computer for its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead\'s risk-taking with the more musically conservative "dadrock" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote that "Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme  This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock." Ryan Schreiber wrote, in a highly enthusiastic ten out of ten review in his online music magazine Pitchfork, that "Radiohead\'s third piece of incredible work, OK Computer, is not only their best yet, but one of the year\'s greatest releases. The record is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing."\n\nDespite OK Computer\'s widespread praise, it also received some criticism. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice granted OK Computer a B\u2212 but ranked it as the "Dud of the Month" in his consumer guide; Christgau commented that the album lacked "soul", calling it "arid" and "ridiculous" and comparing it unfavourably to Pink Floyd. Andy Gill wrote for The Independent in an otherwise positive review, "For all its ambition, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that so luxuriates in its despondency". While a review in Time was largely positive, particularly praising the songs "Airbag", "Paranoid Android", and "Let Down", reviewer Christopher John Farley criticised the second half of the album. Farley stated, "While the first half-dozen tracks reward repeated listenings with melodies that grow and bloom with familiarity, there is often no structure to be found in the remaining half-dozen numbers."\n\nAt the end of 1997, OK Computer appeared in many critics\' lists and listener polls for best album of the year. OK Computer topped the year-end polls of the magazines Mojo, Vox, Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly, and Inpress, and tied for first place with Daft Punk\'s Homework in The Face. The album placed second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and Uncut. Q and Les Inrockuptibles both listed OK Computer in their unranked year-end polls. OK Computer was a nominee for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognizing the best British or Irish album of the year. The album was nominated in the Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the latter award.\n\nOK Computer first appeared in a "best of all time" list three months after its release, placing 16 in a chart based on submissions by customers of Virgin Megastores. This chart heavily favoured recent releases, which suggested that OK Computer\'s popularity was a passing fad. However, OK Computer has since appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. In early 1998, OK Computer topped a Q reader\'s poll of the greatest albums of all time, and in 2001 Q placed it at number one in a list of the top 50 pop albums of the last 15 years. A number of publications, including NME, Melody Maker, Spin, Alternative Press, Pitchfork Media, and Time placed OK Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine\'s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Additionally, retrospective reviews from The A.V. Club and Slant Magazine have received the album favourably; likewise, Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying "Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering."\n\n\nOK Computer was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election. It was thus seen by critics as encompassing public opinion through its "despairing-yet-hopeful tone" and themes of alienation. Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by reading a book about the two decades of Conservative government which were just coming to an end in 1997, as well as about factory farming and globalisation. However, in interviews Yorke expressed little hope things would change under the "New Labour" government of Tony Blair. With the approach of the year 2000, many people felt the tone of the album was millennial.\n\nSome critics have credited OK Computer with "killing" 1990s Britpop, as within a few years of its release, the dominant style of UK guitar pop had become slower and more melancholy. Many of the newer acts used similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements. The band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The Man Who, which became the biggest selling album of 1999 in the UK. Others have credited Radiohead with beginning a mainstream revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, though the band denied their affiliation with the genre. Radiohead described the prevalence of bands that "sound like us" as one reason to break with the style of OK Computer for their next album, Kid A. When asked by MTV interviewer Gideon Yago what the band thought of "bands like Travis, Coldplay, and Muse ... making a career sounding exactly like Radiohead did in 1997", Yorke replied "Good luck with \'Kid A\'!".\n\nSeveral rock bands which later became popular, ranging from Coldplay and Bloc Party to TV on the Radio, have said they were formatively influenced by OK Computer\u2014TV on the Radio\'s debut album, for instance, was titled OK Calculator. Additionally, the album\'s popularity paved the way for British alternative rock bands such as Muse, Snow Patrol, and Keane. Classical and jazz musicians such as Christopher O\'Riley and Brad Mehldau have performed material from OK Computer, and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said "When I heard \'OK Computer,\' after five minutes I said, \'I actually get this. I understand what these people are trying to do.\' And what they were trying was not so drastically different from what I was trying to do." Radiodread is a song for song cover of the album in a Reggae style.\n\nOK Computer has received great acclaim from the public and critics. It is often cited as Radiohead\'s best work and as a landmark album of its time. In 1998, it was nominated for a Grammy Award as Album of the Year, and won for Best Alternative Music Album. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On the verge of a breakdown after promoting Radiohead's 1997 album OK Computer, songwriter Thom Yorke envisioned a radical change in direction. Radiohead replaced their rock sound with synthesisers, drum machines, the ondes Martenot, string orchestras and brass instruments, incorporating influences from genres such as electronic music, krautrock, jazz, and 20th-century classical music. They recorded Kid A with OK Computer producer Nigel Godrich in Paris, Copenhagen, Gloucestershire and their hometown Oxford, England. The sessions produced over 20 tracks; Radiohead saved many of them for their subsequent album, Amnesiac, released the following year.\n\nRadiohead released no singles or music videos to promote Kid A and conducted few interviews and photoshoots, instead becoming one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool. The album was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services and the album was leaked before release.\n\nKid A debuted at the top of the charts in Britain, where it went platinum in the first week, and it became Radiohead's first number-one album in the United States. Like OK Computer, it won a Grammy for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. Its departure from Radiohead's earlier sound initially divided fans and critics, but it later attracted widespread acclaim; at the turn of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it number 67 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Kid+A\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was recorded over a two-year period between 1989 and 1991. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled percussion and feedback. The group cycled through nineteen studios and a larger number of engineers during the album\'s two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached \xa3250,000.\n\nWhile Loveless did not achieve great commercial success upon its release, it received enthusiastic reviews from critics, who praised its sonic innovations and Shields\'s "virtual reinvention of the guitar." Following the record\'s release, My Bloody Valentine were removed from their record label Creation Records due to the difficulty and expense of working with Shields, a factor that was alleged to have contributed to the bankruptcy of the label. In the subsequent years, the group struggled to record a follow-up album and would eventually break up in 1997. Loveless would be their last full-length release for over two decades.\n\nSince its release, Loveless has been widely proclaimed by critics as among the best albums of the 1990s, as a landmark work of the shoegazing genre, and as a significant influence on various subsequent artists. The album was reissued as a two-CD set on Sony in May 2012, containing remastered editions of the original digital tape and a previously unreleased \xbd-inch analogue tape. The reissues placed in several international charts and in July 2013, Loveless was certified Silver in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/My+Bloody+Valentine/Loveless">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With much anticipation for the band\'s second album following on the success of their 1999 self-titled debut (Slipknot), pressures on the band were high. Their relationships with each other suffered and was later described as the darkest time of their career. It was also the first time that guitarist Jim Root had been significantly involved in a Slipknot album due to his joining very late in recording of their debut album, as Root was only featured on two songs from that release. Despite troubles within the band and with Iowa\'s development, Slipknot promoted it for almost a year.\n\nIowa was a major success, it premiered in the top ten album sales charts in nine countries. Generally positively received, it includes some of their notable songs, such as "Disasterpiece", "The Heretic Anthem", "People = Shit" and the two Grammy-nominated songs "Left Behind" and the remix of "My Plague". Critic John Mulvey proclaimed the album as the "absolute triumph of nu metal". While more technical than their debut album, Iowa is considered to be the band\'s heaviest and darkest. It has been certified platinum in the United States and Canada. A special edition of Iowa was reissued on November 1, 2011 to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the record. It was accompanied by a full live audio of the hit DVD Disasterpieces and a film entitled Goat directed by Shawn Crahan with the four music videos, never-seen-before interviews and footage from the Iowa period. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Slipknot/Iowa">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Following a period of public and legal controversy, West retreated to a "self-imposed exile" in Hawaii in 2009. There, he worked on the album in a communal recording environment that involved numerous contributing musicians and producers. A widespread critical success, it was named the best record of 2010 by many publications and has since appeared on several lists ranking the greatest albums of all time. The album features guest appearances from Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, Nicki Minaj, John Legend and more.\n\nProduction was led by West himself, alongside a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West\'s previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.\n\nMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was released on November 22, 2010, by Roc-A-Fella Records. To promote the album, West released free songs through his GOOD Fridays series and four singles: the Billboard hits "Power", "Monster", and "Runaway", and the international hit "All of the Lights". It was also promoted with a short film set to the record\'s music, Runaway. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and eventually sold 1,032,000 copies in the United States. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/My+Beautiful+Dark+Twisted+Fantasy">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Produced by The Avalanches\' members Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann (under the pseudonym Bobbydazzler), it was issued on Modular Recordings. The album was created in two separate near-identical studios by Chater and Seltmann, passing audio mixes of records they sampled. The album contains about 3500 vinyl samples of various genres of music. As it was not originally intended for international release, the duo did not worry about copyright restrictions nor attempt to keep track of which samples they would need to clear.\n\nAfter the album\'s positive reception in Australia, the duo considered an international release \u2013 its date was held back until 2001 in both the United Kingdom and North America and appeared in slightly altered forms. The delay and changes occurred so that the group could obtain permission to use the samples or use replacements. Five singles were spawned by the album, "Electricity", "Frontier Psychiatrist", "Since I Left You", "Radio" and "A Different Feeling". The group promoted the album by organising headlining tours in Australia, Europe and the United States. Since I Left You was issued to favourable reception, it peaked in the top 30 on the ARIA Albums Chart, number 12 in Norway, number eight on the UK Album Charts and, in the United States, at number ten on the Top Electronic Albums chart and in the top 40 on the Top Heatseekers chart. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2001 it won in three categories: Breakthrough Artist \u2013 Album and Best Dance Release, Producer of the Year for Bobbydazzler. The Avalanches won a fourth award, Breakthrough Artist \u2013 Single for "Frontier Psychiatrist". Since I Left You became one of the best reviewed albums of the 2000s. In October 2010, it was listed at No. 10 in the book, 100 Best Australian Albums. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Avalanches/Since+I+Left+You">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on September 11, 2007, and is the band\'s first release for Domino Records. The title and track listing were revealed by band member Geologist on the Collected Animals message board on May 16, 2007. The press response to Strawberry Jam was mostly positive, with some lauding its unique sound as a large step forward in the band\'s evolution. The album charted on the Billboard Top 200, debuting and peaking at #72.\n\nStrawberry Jam was released on iTunes with an exclusive live version of "Cuckoo Cuckoo", the video for "Peacebone", and a digital reproduction of the album\'s booklet.\n\nRecording\nThe Album was recorded at Wave Lab Studios in Tucson, Arizona. Band member Brian Weitz explained why they chose this location on the Collected Animals message board:\n\n"dave  and i were talking a few months back about environments to record and one of us was like maybe it\'d be sweet to make this next one a desert record and then everyone was like yeah man we haven\'t done that yet and it seems like it could fit the songs and the way we want them to sound. that might not make sense to anyone but us because when you think of the desert you think of twangy guitars and morricone soundtracks and jim morrison walking with the ghost of an indian, but we don\'t really see it that way. we looked at a bunch of studios from southern california to new mexico and settled on one we liked in tucson. plus i\'ve spent about a year and a half of my life living in the tucson area"\n\nMoreover, Strawberry Jam engineer Scott Colburn, who also worked with the band to record the predecessor Feels, knew Wave Lab\'s owner. According to member Noah Lennox, it was a conscious decision to record the album "in a desert setting."\n\nAlbum content\nIn a pre-release interview with Billboard, guitarist Deakin described the new album as "chiseled" and "shiver-inducing". According to the interview, the majority of the album\'s songs were played on the band\'s live shows from 2005 to 2006, but that there would be, "nonetheless, a few new ones that we\'ve never played live."\n\nTwo songs that had been played extensively on the band\'s 2005\u20132006 concerts, "Safer" and "Street Flash", were not included on Strawberry Jam. Regarding the songs\' absences, singer and guitarist Avey Tare wrote to fans that the band recorded studio versions for both, but decided against including them on the album, "partially due to their length(s)". "Safer" was eventually released as the B-side of the album\'s first single, "Peacebone", while "Street Flash" and other studio leftovers appeared on the 2008 EP Water Curses.\n\nTitle and cover art\nThe name Strawberry Jam came from singer and drummer Panda Bear as he and the band were on a plane headed to Greece for a show. Upon receiving his complimentary tray of food, he opened up the packet of strawberry jam that had been provided for the bread. As he removed the cover of the packet, he was drawn to the look of the glistening jam, and he expressed his desire for the production of their new album to sound like the jam looked, "that is to say, something that\'s really synthetic and sharp and futuristic looking," but also "tangy and sweet, almost in a kind of aggressive way in terms of the way it tastes".\n\nAvey Tare created and photographed the cover art. Additional layout and design was done by Rob Carmichael, with whom Animal Collective has collaborated on several other projects.\n\nInternet leak\nThe album\'s internet leak on June 12, 2007, was notable in that it was leaked in three song clusters over a period of weeks. Geologist wrote on the Collected Animals board that the first batch of promotional copies were watermarked, and that each journalist\'s name would be digitally embedded in any extracted files. On June 19, 2007, a letter from the band\'s publicist was sent to music journalists regarding the leaking of the first three songs:\n\nLast week three tracks from Animal Collective\'s new album leaked. Within minutes we were able to track the leak to a writer\'s CD. That person got in more trouble than you care to hear about and was almost fired. The person was also forced to write an apology letter to an entire staff of people and the head of Domino Records along with other penance.\n\n\nPanda Bear talked with Shout Mouth regarding the band\'s thoughts on the leak:\n\nThe only thing we\u2019re really upset about with the leak is that it\u2019s only parts of it. I think there are six songs out there now. People aren\u2019t even able to get the full experience of the album, which bums us all out quite a bit. So if you\u2019re listening leakers , put up those other three songs, man, pronto.\nThe remaining three tracks - "Fireworks", "Cuckoo Cuckoo" and "Derek" - were all leaked on July 4, 2007. <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective/Strawberry+Jam">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was later retroactively classified as the debut album by experimental pop band Animal Collective. The album was first released as a CD on the band's own Animal label (now known as Paw Tracks) with only 2000 copies produced.\n\nIt was reissued as a double CD along with Danse Manatee in 2003 on FatCat Records, and later on limited edition vinyl through FatCat. Both UK and US pressings used DMM mastering.\n\nAll of the songs were written by Avey Tare (David Portner) from 1997 to 1999, except for \"Penny Dreadfuls\" which was written when he was 16 years old. The process was strongly inspired by his move from Baltimore to New York, which he described as a \"dark time\" with Brian Weitz (Geologist) being his only friend in the city. Portner and Panda Bear (Noah Lennox) recorded the acoustic guitar and the drums live onto a Tascam 48 eight-track reel-to-reel in Portner's bedroom in Maryland during the summer of 1999. The piano songs along with overdubs were recorded in Portner's parents' living room. Portner wanted the guitar to be \"jangled to create this fluttering feeling\".\n\nAn old Roland SH-2 synthesizer, which Weitz's brother found stored in a camp, was used for the bass sounds. The drums were played with brushes to emulate the albums Ocean Rain and Forever Changes. Avey Tare would dictate what he wanted the rhythm to be through beatboxing. Other sounds, such as the majority of \"Spirit They've Vanished\", were created through the use of feedback loops.\n\nFuture Animal Collective member Deakin (Josh Dibb) helped with the promotion and sent packages to record companies. Portner recalled, \"Southern Records called us back immediately and said \u2018Is there something wrong with this? This music makes our dogs run out of the room\u2019!\"\n\nThe original cover art was found by Avey Tare, who considered it fitting. The art was later discovered to be an illustration by Dorothy P. Lathrop from the book Stars To-Night: Verses New and Old for Boys and Girls by Sara Teasdale. The album was intended to be released under Avey Tare's name alone, but he was so impressed by Panda Bear's drumming that he added Panda's name on the front cover. This method of choosing monikers for Animal Collective's recorded output\u2014naming themselves after who played on each respective album\u2014would last until 2003's Campfire Songs.\n\nIncluded with the original release was an insert with the following story:\n\n\"Not long ago a young boy named Avey and his friend Panda Bear roamed the patch work which covers the land (some call it forest). They were looked upon by Pan and raised by fairies and the Angels of light who play deep within the Wood. 'Let's make the music of childhood,' Avey shouted one day as the two played. Panda thought this idea was a good one. 'I can use my magical Rythm  sticks and you can play your Sun harp,' he said. So the two began to create melodies and Panda brought rythms  from every direction while Avey sang. All of the songs were about wooden toys and invisible friends and filled with the light of the forest. This is the first group of songs they played.\"\n\nThe title is a quote uttered by Mr. Magoo in Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol.\n\nThere has been some confusion about the album's track listing. On the original, limited release, the untitled track #3 was not listed along with the other songs. Since the track listing gave no corresponding track numbers to the rest of the songs, it was incorrectly assumed that tracks #3-9 were actually titled as tracks #4-10 are here, and that \"Alvin Row\" had no title. This error appears in nearly every review of Spirit following its initial release in 2000. The 2003 FatCat reissue cleared up this misunderstanding by numbering the songs and leaving a blank space for track #3.\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective/Spirit+They%27re+Gone,+Spirit+They%27ve+Vanished\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was released in North America on 1 January 2008. In Rainbows was Radiohead\'s first release after the end of their contract with EMI and the end of the longest gap between studio albums in their career.\n\nIn Rainbows was recorded in London, Somerset, Wiltshire and Oxfordshire with producers Mark Stent and Nigel Godrich. Radiohead worked on the songs for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In between recording, the band toured Europe and North America for three months in 2006. Radiohead used a wide variety of musical styles on the album, incorporating string arrangements and electronic music, pianos, celestes and the ondes Martenot, yet renewing their focus on guitars, drums and bass as lead instruments. The songwriting on In Rainbows was more personal than that of Radiohead\'s other work, with singer Thom Yorke describing it as his attempt to write "seduction songs".\n\n Upon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the United World Chart, UK Album Chart, and the U.S. Billboard 200 at number one.

It was released on August 30, 2019, by Polydor and Interscope Records. The album was primarily produced by Del Rey and Jack Antonoff, with additional contributions from Zach Dawes, Andrew Watt and longtime Del Rey collaborator Rick Nowels.\n\nMusically, Norman Fucking Rockwell! features a soft rock sound consisting of psych-rock jams and piano ballads, and features references to various classic rock artists. The name of the album is a reference to the painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell.\n\nThe first singles from the album, "Mariners Apartment Complex" and "Venice Bitch", were released in September 2018, followed by "Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman like Me to Have \u2013 but I Have It", "Doin\' Time", "The Greatest", and "Norman Fucking Rockwell" in 2019.\n\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! received widespread critical acclaim, and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards, while the title track was nominated for Song of the Year. It was listed by several publications as one of the best albums of the decade, and in the years following its release, of all time. To promote the album, Del Rey embarked on a concert tour, titled The Norman Fucking Rockwell! Tour.\n\nDel Rey announced she had begun working on a follow up material to 2017\'s Lust for Life in January 2018. Del Rey confirmed she had been working on songs including one titled "Bartender", but did not know if it would be featured on an album. In September 2018, Del Rey revealed that the album was nearly complete, and that she had recorded eleven tracks for it.  In a September 2019 livestream on Instagram, Del Rey announced that the album was almost named Bird World.\n\nFLOOD Magazine described the album\'s sound as "a mellow soft rock" and noted that Del Rey\'s improved lyrics tackle larger themes than her previous work. According to critics, Norman Fucking Rockwell! features "psych-rock jams" and piano-based ballads. Consequence of Sound described the record as featuring "psych-pop lullabies, tales of complicated, consuming romantic love, and overt odes to the tarnished dream of California." It has been characterised as a "pop classic", as well as embodying folk rock, and existing somewhere between the desert rock and "minimalist" trip hop of Del Rey\'s previous efforts.\n\nThe album features a strong influence from \'70s classic rock. Kitty Empire of The Observer noted that "strings and synth washes soundtrack multiple love songs", and also noted several classic rock references throughout the album, including Neil Young\'s "Cinnamon Girl", Crosby, Stills, & Nash, and Led Zeppelin\'s Houses of the Holy. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the album\'s "Laurel Canyon \'70s soft-rock fantasies", including references to Joni Mitchell and the Eagles.\n\nNo Ripcord describes Norman Fucking Rockwell! as "a remarkably sharp pop record that retains her fascination with pop-culture iconography and the rosey simplicity of a post-war America where classic rock and blue jeans ruled and takes them to much deeper places".\n\nThe album\'s cover art, release date, and track listing were announced by Del Rey on July 31, 2019. The cover art features Del Rey and Duke Nicholson\u2014actor Jack Nicholson\'s grandson\u2014posing on a sailboat, with the album title and Del Rey\'s initials written in a comic-inspired style. The photo was taken by Del Rey\'s sister, photographer Chuck Grant. The following day, Del Rey released an album trailer. On August 2, Urban Outfitters announced an exclusive vinyl of the album featuring an alternative album artwork. The alternative cover was also shot by Chuck Grant.\n\nThroughout 2018, Del Rey shared snippets via social media of several songs intended for the album, including "Happiness Is a Butterfly", "How to Disappear", and "Cinnamon Girl". She performed "How to Disappear" on October 29 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, debuting the full song for the first time. A trailer for the album was released on August 1, 2019. It features three of the album\'s singles\u2014"Doin\' Time", "Mariners Apartment Complex", and "Venice Bitch"\u2014as well as the title track. On August 22, 2019, "Fuck It, I Love You" and "The Greatest" were released as promotional singles along with a double music video. The music video runs at 9:19 minutes long, with the same shoot as the album trailer.\n\n"Mariners Apartment Complex" was released as the album\'s first single on September 12, 2018.\n\nThe following week, on September 18, Del Rey released the second single, "Venice Bitch" and revealed the album title.\n\n"Hope Is a Dangerous Thing for a Woman like Me to Have \u2013 but I Have It" followed as the third single on January 9, 2019.\n\nDel Rey released a cover of Sublime\'s "Doin\' Time" on May 17, 2019, for a documentary about the band. It also served as the fourth single from the album. The music video was released on August 29, 2019, one day before the release of her upcoming album; "Norman Fucking Rockwell!".\n\nA double music video for "Fuck It I Love You" and "The Greatest" was released on August 22, 2019. They both served as two promotional singles. "The Greatest" was later released as the album\'s fifth single on September 13, 2019, in Italy.\n\n"Norman Fucking Rockwell", the title track, was released on November 1, 2019 in the UK as the sixth and final single of this era\n\nOn August 1, 2019, Del Rey announced two legs of a tour in promotion of Norman Fucking Rockwell!. The first leg took place in North America in the fall of 2019, and the second in Europe in early 2020. The European leg of the tour was subsequently cancelled due to illness.\n\nOn December 20, 2019, Del Rey released a 14-minute-long short film featuring the songs "Norman Fucking Rockwell", "Bartender", and "Happiness is a Butterfly". The film was directed by Chuck Grant and premiered on YouTube.\n\nNorman Fucking Rockwell! received widespread acclaim from music critics and is also the most critically acclaimed studio album of Del Rey\'s career to date. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87 based on 28 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".\n\nJenn Pelly of Pitchfork wrote that the album "establishes  as one of America\u2019s greatest living songwriters". In his review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield wrote that "the long-awaited Norman Fucking Rockwell is even more massive and majestic than everyone hoped it would be. Lana turns her fifth and finest album into a tour of sordid American dreams, going deep cover in all our nation\'s most twisted fantasies of glamour and danger." He concluded that Del Rey "has finally made her pop classic." In a five-star review for NME, Rhian Daly called the album "nothing short of stunning." Kristel Jax of Now wrote that "Del Rey has shifted her kitschy patriotic fixation, dropping her flag-draped persona and making peace with a more complex, dystopian reality", also giving the album five stars. For Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani described the album as being "a heady collection of psych-rock and piano dirges that pour into each other and rarely shift tempo from track to track" as well as "frank assessments of the psychic effects of a world spiraling into chaos." Also writing positively, Alexandra Pollard of The Independent wrote that "The album is sultry and soporific, sitting somewhere between the minimalist trip-hop of Del Rey\u2019s early days, and the scuzzy desert rock she has toyed with over the years," and concluded that "This is Del Rey at her most assertive." In his \'premature evaluation\' for Stereogum, Tom Breihan wrote that the album is "a beautiful opus for a new dark age \u2014 a fond look back at the world we just wrecked", calling it "yoga music for the apocalypse."\n\nIn a more mixed review, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the album as "an alternately beguiling and frustrating experience", concluding that despite Del Rey\'s evident talent, "it\u2019s hard not to wish that she would broaden her perspective, adopt a different persona, shake things up a little." Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph similarly wrote that the album "reveals Del Rey to be something of a one trick pony, but what a beautiful trick it is\n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 with 104,000 album-equivalent units, of which 66,000 were pure album sales, making it Del Rey\'s sixth US top ten album. In its second week, the album dropped to number nine with 35,000 units.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number one with 31,539 copies, becoming her best first week sales in the country since Ultraviolence. The album became Lana Del Rey\'s fourth number one album in the UK tying Taylor Swift as the female artist with the most solo number one albums in the UK during the 2010s. In France, the album sold 8,000 copies in its first week, 800 more than Lust for Life\'s first week\n\nLana Del Rey \u2013 vocals, horns (9)\nJack Antonoff \u2013 keyboards (1\u20134, 6\u20138, 11, 13), piano (1\u20134, 6\u20138, 11, 13, 14), drums (2\u20134, 8, 11), programming (2\u20134, 6\u20138, 11, 13), acoustic guitar (2\u20134, 8, 11), electric guitar (2\u20134, 6\u20138, 11, 13), synthesizers (3), percussion (8), vibraphone (8)\nEvan Smith \u2013 saxophone (1, 11), flute (11)\nPhillip Peterson \u2013 baritone (1), cello (1, 6, 11), flugelhorn (1)\nVictoria Parker \u2013 violin (1, 6, 11)\nLaura Sisk \u2013 additional programming (2)\nChad Smith - drums (4)\nMikey Freedom Hart \u2013 keyboards (4), Mellotron (9), piano (9), drums (10), programming (10)\nAndrew Watt \u2013 instrumentation (5), programming (5), guitar (5)\nEric Wilson \u2013 bass guitar (5)\nJosh Freese \u2013 drums (5)\nBud Gaugh \u2013 drums (5)\nGale Levant \u2013 harp (5)\nWoozy Biff \u2013 harp (9)\nZachary Dawes \u2013 piano (9)\nLoren Humphrey \u2013 drums (9)\nDarren Weiss \u2013 drums (9)\nMike Riddleberger \u2013 drums (9)\nSean Hutchinson \u2013 drums (9)\nEvan Weiss \u2013 guitar (9)\nBenji Lysaght \u2013 guitar (9)\nTyler Parkford \u2013 Hammond B3 (9)\nDean Reid \u2013 bass guitar (9), keyboards (10), guitar (10), FX (10), programming (10)\nKieron Menzies \u2013 Mellotron (9), drums (10), FX (10), programming (10)\nRick Nowels \u2013 keyboards (10), acoustic guitar (10), piano (12)\nGrace Wang \u2013 keyboards (1)\nZac Rae \u2013 keyboards (10)\nDavid Levita \u2013 guitar (10) <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Lana+Del+Rey/Norman+Fucking+Rockwell!">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
